        <h1><p>(Race)</p></h1>
        <p><i>The Magnorite, a typically sullen, reclusive, and violent race (with rare exceptions) made of the earth and molten rock. Their skin is formed of rock and cracked in places, forming unique patterns much like the Ardoni, which reveal their lava-like blood. It is unclear if these cracks are unhealed wounds or genetic markings. Magnorites are strong, though terrible builders, often occupying patchwork buildings or old, stolen houses and caves. </i></p>
        <p><i>Typically residing in the rocky and harsh lands in the South of Ardonia, Magnorites form secluded societies. In these societies, strength is determined by the number of skulls claimed from defeated foes. The more the skulls, the stronger the Magnorite.</i></p>
