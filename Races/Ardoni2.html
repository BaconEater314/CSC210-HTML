        <h1><p>Ardoni (Post 1710 DR)</p></h1>
        <p><i>The Ardoni are a race of innately magical humanoids that journeyed from Mazteca. The Ardoni are formidable warriors and mages due to their innate magical abilities, unique to them. Upon death, they are buried in special graveyards with stone markings matching theirs so they may forever shine on.</i></p>
        <p><i>Each Ardoni possesses a unique pattern of markings all over their slate grey bodies that are inherited from one of their parents and glows with the color of their clan. Their eyes also glow softly the same color as their patterns, as well as the edges of their pointy ears, which grow longer as they age. When they die, their glow goes out, and as they age, they dim. Aging at the same rate as humans, they reach maturity at 18 and live up to 800 years, though few make it that far. The Ardoni are divided into 5 clans, not including the clanless: The Voltaris (Red), The Sendaris (Blue), The Nestoris (Yellow), The Kaltaris (Green), and the Mendoris (Purple). All Ardoni have the last name of their clan.</i></p>

        <div>
            <p><b>Creature Type:</b> You are Humanoid</p>
            <p><b>Size:</b> You are medium or small. You choose the size when you select this race. Ardoni range in height in build, but typical Ardoni range from 5’ 6” upwards to 7’.</p>
            <p><b>Speed:</b> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>

            <p><b>Songs of War:</b> The Ardoni have the unique ability to use “Songs”, magical abilities bonded to the user until death. At special shrines, an Ardoni may bond with one of each type over the course of an hour. Each Ardoni may also only wield one song of each category. Songs come in cube forms that are dropped upon death to be bonded by another Ardoni or sold to the right buyer for a decent amount of money.</p>
            <p> The Songs come in 5 variants: Supporium (Green), Protisium (Blue), Mobilium (Yellow), Aggressium (Red), and Elementium (Purple). Of each type, there is a variant called a Prime Song, which allows the user to use every song of that type. These are deemed too powerful for one person to wield and are kept safe with the eldest of elders of each clan (called a Master).</p>

            <p><b>Weapon Training:</b> You gain proficiency with the Longsword, Greatsword, Glaive, Double-Bladed Scimitar, and War Staff</p>

            <p><b>Darkvision:</b> You have Darkvision out to 60 feet.</p>
            <p><b>Languages:</b> You can speak, read, and write Common and Ardoni. Ardoni is a strange musical language that is often pleasant to the ears.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Clans</h2>
        <p>The Ardoni are divided into 5 clans, not including the clanless. The clan determines your pattern color, last name, and typically which type of Song you may start with. Your clan is your identity. You may get more reaction, respect, or help from your clan members.</p>
        <div>
            <p><b>Voltaris.</b></p>
            <p>The Voltaris clan is represented by the color red. They are the more aggressive of the Ardoni and, as such, were not entrusted with the safekeeping of a Prime Song.</p>

            <p><b>Starting Song:</b> Aggressium</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p><b>Sendaris.</b></p>
            <p>The Sendaris clan is represented by the color blue. They were entrusted with the Mobillium Prime Song. As a result, their people usually wield Mobillium Songs. You start with one by default. The Sendaris typically lean on the good side of things, much like the Nestoris.</p>

            <p><b>Starting Song:</b> Mobilium</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p><b>Nestoris.</b></p>
            <p>The Nestoris clan is represented by the color yellow. They were entrusted with the Aggressium Prime Song, the most dangerous of the four. As a result, their people usually wield Agressium Songs. You start with one by default. The Nestoris typically lean on the good side of things, much like the Sendaris.</p>

            <p><b>Starting Song:</b> Aggressium</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p><b>Mendoris.</b></p>
            <p>The Mendoris clan is represented by the color purple. They were entrusted with the Protisium Prime Song. As a result, their people usually wield Protisium Songs. You start with one by default. The Mendoris are a pacifist clan and widely prefer peace, but will fight for it if necessary.</p>

            <p><b>Starting Song:</b> Protisium</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p><b>Kaltaris.</b></p>
            <p>The Kaltaris clan is represented by the color green. They were entrusted with the Supporium Prime Song. As a result, their people usually wield Supporium Songs. You start with one by default. The Kaltaris are good fighters and are typically neutral.</p>

            <p><b>Starting Song:</b> Supporium</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p><b>Clanless.</b></p>
            <p>An Ardoni that has no clan is known as a Clanless. All Ardoni are clanless when born and are initiated into their clan by a Master, typically at a young age. Though Clans are not determined by biology, pure-bloods can exist whose lineage stems entirely from one clan. A Clanless adult is very rare and typically results from an abandoned or orphaned baby. A Clanless may choose a Song of a Clan they were adopted by or none at all.</p>

            <p><b>Starting Song:</b> None</p>
        </div>


        <h2>Songs</h2>
        <p>The Songs are divided into four different categories: Supporium, Protisium, Mobilium, and Aggressium. The following tables describe the names of each Song and what they do. All songs may be used a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus per day. Prime Songs gain extra uses.</p>
        <p>The Song Save DC is determined by one of the following (You choose when picking this race):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spellcasting DC</li>
            <li>8 + Proficiency Bonus + one of the following:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Intelligence Modifier</li>
                <li>Wisdom Modifier</li>
                <li>Charisma Modifier</li>
                <li>Constitution Modifier</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>The Song Attack bonus is determined by one of the following (You choose when picking this race):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spell Attack Modifier</li>
            <li>Proficiency Bonus + one of the following:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Intelligence Modifier</li>
                <li>Wisdom Modifier</li>
                <li>Charisma Modifier</li>
                <li>Constitution Modifier</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>Most Songs use your Proficiency Bonus for their calculations. This is shortened to PB.</p>
