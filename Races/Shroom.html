        <h1><p>Shroomanoid</p></h1>
        <p><i>You are a sentient mushroom, a shroomanoid if you will. The shroom race is quite different from other Underdark fungal humanoids, perhaps originating from a different species of fungus. The shroom has origins in enchanted forests where the border between the Material Plane and the Feywild is less defined.</i></p>
        
        <p><b>Small Problems: </b> You come from a shroom colony that typically inhabits a single downed tree or humid cave. Shroomanoids rarely venture from their home and typically don’t get involved in life outside their domain. Think about what has caused you to leave your home in search of adventure.</p>

        <div>
            <p><b>Creature Type:</b> Your creature type is Plant.</p>
            <p><b>Size:</b> You are small. Shroomanoids range from 2.5-3.5 ft tall.</p>
            <p><b>Speed:</b> Your base walking speed is 30 ft.</p>

            <p><b>Age:</b> Shroomanoids mature at 5 years and die around age 30.</p>
            <p><b>Fungal Resilience:</b> Fungal Resilience. You are resistant to poison damage and cannot be poisoned.</p>
            <p><b>Damaging Spores:</b> As a reaction to receiving damage from an attack you can see within 5 feet, spores are released into the air around you. Non-allied creatures adjacent to you must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8+Proficiency bonus + Con modifier or your spell save DC), taking 1d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.</p>
            <p>The damage increases to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 9th, 4d6 at 13th, and 5d6 at 17th.</p>

            <p><b>Languages:</b> You can speak, read, and write common and one other language of your choice. You also speak Shroomish, a non-written language mostly consisting of “meeps” and “boops”.</p>

        <h2>Subraces</h2>
        <p><i>The Shroomanoids come in two varieties. Those from the woods, and those from the deep.</i></p>
        <div>
            <p><b>Mushroom of the Woods</b></p>
            <p><i>You and your people come from mushrooms in deep forests on the surface, colonies often found in large trees and fallen logs. Your people consist of bright colors and are well adjusted to the sunlight.</i></p>

            <p><b>Guardian of the Deep Wood:</b> You have advantage on Wisdom (survival) checks and Intelligence (nature) checks in forest environments, as well as advantage on Dexterity (stealth) checks made to hide in them.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p><b>Mushroom of the Deep</b></p>
            <p><i>You and your people come from mushrooms in from deep underground, colonies often found in dark caves and dank crypts. Your people are well adapted to the darkness and gloom.</i></p>

            <p><b>Darkvision:</b> You have a range of Darkvision out to 60 feet.</p>
