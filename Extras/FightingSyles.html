        <h1>Additional Fighting Styles</h1>

        <h3>Pointblank Shot</h3>
        <p>You no longer have disadvantage on ranged attacks within melee range of enemy creatures.</p>
        
        <h3>Double Barrel Master</h3>
        <p>You can wield the Lightning Shotblaster with one hand, but you cannot have one in each hand.</p>

        <h3>Cowboy</h3>
        <p>You can wield a Lightning Revolver in one hand and one non-two-handed weapon in the other. Burst Fire no longer results in you landing prone.</p>

        <h3>Strong Arsenal</h3>
        <p>For Firearms you have a Weapon Mastery for, you may instead use Strength for ranged weapon attacks with that weapon.</p>
