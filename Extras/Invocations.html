        <h3>Elemental Blast</h3>
        <p><i>Prerequisite: A damage-dealing cantrip, 4th level.</i></p>
        <p>You’ve learned how to channel different types of elemental energies through your cantrips. Choose one of your damage-dealing cantrips. When you cast it, you can change the damage type to either fire, cold, lightning, or acid damage. This must be declared before you make the attack roll.</p>
        
        <h3>Close Range Blast</h3>
        <p><i>Prerequisite: A ranged damage-dealing cantrip.</i></p>
        <p>You’ve learned how to make the best of enemies close to you. Choose one of your ranged damage dealing cantrips. You can now cast it as a melee spell against targets within 5 feet.</p>

        <h3>Pact Weapon Mastery</h3>
        <p><i>Prerequisite: Pact of the Blade, Level 5</i></p>
        <p>When you bond a weapon using your Pact of the Blade feature (not conjuring it) you gain Weapon Mastery for that bonded weapon. You retain Weapon Mastery while bound to that weapon until you bind another weapon or unbind it.</p>
