        <p><i>Magic Equipment, uncommon</i></p>

        <p><b>Lifeward.</b> This magical amulet protects those who stray close to death's door. When you are reduced to 0 hit points (but not killed outright) while wearing this amulet, you instead regain a number of hit points equal to your level. This amulet then shatters and is unusable.</p>
