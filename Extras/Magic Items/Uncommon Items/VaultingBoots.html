        <h1>Vaulting Boots</h1>
        <p><i>Magic Equipment (Boots), uncommon</i></p>

        <p><b>Platform Vault.</b> These black boots allow the wearer to summon small, round orange platforms underneath one of their feet in the air as an extra step. Three steps are allowed in the air before the boots fail to give more, allowing the user to climb a total of 15 feet. Upon returning to the ground, the user may again use the boots to vault through the air. By using these platforms strategically, the user can negate up to thirty feet of fall damage. </p>

        <p><b>Platform Push.</b> Additionally, one can use a bonus action to push another creature within 5ft away by kicking them and activating a platform to push them. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or DC 8 + proficiency bonus + Strength Modifier or be pushed 10 feet away and knocked prone. Creatures larger than you have advantage on this saving throw.</p>
