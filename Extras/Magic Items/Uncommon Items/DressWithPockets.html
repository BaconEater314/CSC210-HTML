        <h1>Dress with Pockets</h1>
        <p><i>Magic Equipment, Uncommon</i></p>

        <p><b>It has pockets!</b> This dress provides a base AC of 12. It has two pockets on either side that are extra-dimensional spaces that can hold up to 50 lbs each. This dress can change its appearance once per long rest, but cannot be overtly fancy.</p>

        <p><b>Curse: It has pockets.</b> If anyone says they like your dress, you are obligated to say some form of “Thanks, it has pockets,” and show them the pockets.</p>
