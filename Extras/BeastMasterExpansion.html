        <h3>Actions</h3>
        <hr color="black">
        <div>
            <p><b>Claw (Grunt, Guard, Slasher Only).</b> Melee Weapon Attack:  your spell attack modifier to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 1d8 + 3 + PB (+1d8 for slashers) slashing damage.</p>
            <p><b>Guard (Guard Only).</b> The guard raises its armored front feet, increasing its AC by 10 and reducing its speed by 10. Every time an enemy rolls between its normal AC and its current AC, the AC is reduced by 2. Bludgeoning weapons reduce this by 5. This lasts until the guard attacks or its armor is completely broken (reduced back to its normal state), after which the guard cannot use this ability again. Reusing this ability with partially broken armor does not reset the armor bonus. The guard regrows up to 5 AC from its guard at the end of short rest.</p>
            <p><b>Web Spit (Web Spitter Only).</b> Ranged Weapon Attack: your spell attack modifier to hit, range 120ft, one target. Hit: 1d4 + PB cold damage, target is blinded and has their move speed halved until the end of their next turn.</p>
            <p><b>Acid Spit (Acid Spitter Only).</b> Ranged Weapon Attack: your spell attack modifier to hit, range 120ft, one target. Hit:  1d8 + 1 + PB acid damage. For the next three rounds, the target takes 1d4 acid damage at the start of its turn. This can stack.</p>
            <p><b>Shit Spread (Septic Spreader Only).</b> The Septic Spreader launches a glob of acid at a point it can see within 60 ft. All spaces within 5 feet are covered in acid for 1d4 rounds. Any creature that enters the space for the first time or ends its turn in the space takes 2d6 acid damage.</p>
