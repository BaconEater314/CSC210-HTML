        <h2>Armors</h2>
        <p>While these armor changes are designed for the Upside setting since firearms are lightning based and it puts metal armor at a disadvantage,
            they technically can be used in any setting.

        <h3><b><u>Light Armor</u></b></h3>
        <p></b>Leather:</b> The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials. </p>
        <p><b>Studded Leather:</b> Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.</p>
        <p><b>Padded:</b> Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.</p>
        <p><b>Glyphid Hide</b> Armor made of Glyphid Grunt hide and carapace, a light, but noisy material that is not incredibly comfortable, but more durable than most other armors of its type. Oftentimes, stealth is hard with this armor as the carapace chunks clink and clack together.</p>

        <h3><b><u>Medium Armor</u></b></h2>
        <p><b>Hide:</b> Armor made from thick furs and pelts tanned.</p>
        <p><b>Thick Cloth:</b> Armor made with thickly woven layers of cloth. Surprisingly effective against firearms and weapons, though annoyingly hot to wear.</p>
        <p><b>Slasher Hide:</b> Armor made of the notorious Glyphid Slasher hide with spikes and blades. This armor scrapes against nearby surfaces and itself, making it hard to sneak with this armor.</p>
        <p><b>Plastic:</b> Densely woven fabrics interlaced with plastic sheets. Stealth with this armor is made hard by the plastic plates colliding.</p>

        <h3><b><u>Heavy Armor</u></b></h3>
        <p><b>Guard Hide:</b> Armor made with the thick and durable plates of the Glyphid Guard. While durable and quite protective, this armor is quite heavy.</p>
        <p><b>Praetorian Mail:</b> Armor made with the green carapace of the Glyphid Praetorian. Thick, heavy, and quite protective. Does not blend in well with its surroundings.</p>
        <p><b>Oppressor Plate:</b> A full suit of the heaviest, most durable bits of armor that Glyphids have, from the huge beast, the Oppressor. Stops most bolts and weapon attacks in their tracks.</p>

        <h3><b><u>Shields</u></b></h3>
        <p><b>Buckler:</b> Small shield made to be used in tandem with heavier weapons. Can be used with two-handed weapons; however adds a -1 penalty to rolls made while equipped.</p>
        <p><b>Standard Shield:</b> A normal rounded or kite shield, meant for protecting oneself. Not usable with two-handed weapons.</p>
        <p><b>Tower Shield:</b> A massive shield, typically 5 feet tall. While protective, it is quite unwieldy. It can be placed on its side on the ground, giving half cover to the creature behind it and allowing for the placement of mountable weapons.</p>
