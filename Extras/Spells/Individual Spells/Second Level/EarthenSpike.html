        <h1>Earthen Spike</h1>
        <p><i>2nd Level Transmutation</i></p>

        <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 Action</p>
        <p><b>Range:</b> 30ft</p>

        <p>You thrust your hand toward the ground, summoning a line of spikes up to a target within range. Any creature in this line takes 1d4 piercing damage. When the line reaches its target, you thrust your hand upward, creating a massive rocky spike that explodes from the ground. The target and adjacent creatures must make a Dexterity saving throw, the target taking 3d8 piercing damage and getting knocked prone on a fail, or half as much on a success. Adjacent creatures take 3d4 piercing damage on a fail. Creatures Huge or larger cannot be knocked prone.</p>

        <p><b>At Higher Levels:</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for the d8s and 1d4 for the d4s for each slot level above 2nd. Additionally, when cast at 4th level, the spike may knock Huge or smaller creatures prone, and Gargantuan creatures at 6th. </p>
