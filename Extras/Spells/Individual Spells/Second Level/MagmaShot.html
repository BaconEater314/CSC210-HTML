        <h1>Magma Shot</h1>
        <p><i>2nd Level Magma Sorcery</i></p>

        <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 Action</p>
        <p><b>Range:</b> 60ft</p>
        <p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>
        <p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

        <p>You fire a glob of magma from the top of your staff to a point within range. All creatures within 10 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 fire damage on a failure or half as much on a success. The area is then coated with magma for 1d4 turns, dealing 1d6 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn there or enters it for the first time. This magma is also considered difficult terrain.</p>

        <p><b>At Higher Levels:</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 and 1d6, respectively, for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
