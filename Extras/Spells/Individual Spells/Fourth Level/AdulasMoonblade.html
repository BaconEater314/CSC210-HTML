        <h1>Adula’s Moonblade</h1>
        <p><i>4th Level Carian Sorcery</i></p>

        <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 Action</p>

        <p>You summon a massive blade at the end of your staff that slices through objects and foes alike. Make a melee spell attack roll against two targets, dealing 4d6 + your spellcasting modifier Force damage on a hit. </p>
        <p>All creatures in a 15ft wide, 25 ft long line when you swing must make a Dexterity Saving throw, taking 2d6 force damage on a failure, or half as much on a success. Creatures hit by this spell’s melee attack have disadvantage on the saving throw.</p>
        <p>If you benefit from extra attack or have another action on your turn, you may swing the magic blade again on your turn without expending a spell slot.</p>
