        <h1>Rellana's Twin Moons</h1>
        <p><i>8th Level Moon Sorcery</i></p>

        <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 Action</p>
        <p><b>Range:</b> Self (20ft Radius)</p>
        <p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>
        <p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

        <p>You levitate yourself into the air and curl into a ball, forming a large moon around you. Your moon creates a twin that slams into the ground shortly before yours does. All creatures in a 20ft radius sphere (not including you) must make 2 Dexterity saving throws, taking 8d6 force damage per failure, or half as much of each on a success.</p>
        <p>A creature that fails the first of the two saving throws has disadvantage on the second.</p>
        <p>You cannot cast this spell if your move speed is zero.</p>

        <p><b>At Higher Levels:</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the damage increases by 2d6 for both moons.</p>
