        <p>Channeling deep magma beneath the earth, you slam your staff into the ground, sending magma hurtling in the air around you. All creatures in a 15ft radius sphere centered on you (excluding you) must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d8 fire damage on a fail, or half as much on a success. The area in the sphere becomes difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.</p>
        <p>As an action on subsequent turns while concentrating, you can create this effect again. </p>
