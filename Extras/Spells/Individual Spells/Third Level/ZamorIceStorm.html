        <h1>Zamor Ice Storm</h1>
        <p><i>3rd Level Cold Sorcery</i></p>

        <p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>
        <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 minute (Concentration)</p>

        <p>Slamming your staff or hands into the ground, you create a large ice storm around you. All creatures in a 20ft radius sphere centered on you (excluding you) must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d6 cold damage on a failure, reducing their move speed by half, or half as much on a failure with no adverse effects.</p>
        <p>You can continue to channel this spell at the start of your turn as an action while you concentrate, forcing all creatures in the area to make the save again. While concentrating on this spell, your move speed is reduced by half.</p>

        <p><b>At Higher Levels:</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
