        <p>You conjure a mote of roiling magma to a point within range, which remains there while you concentrate. When your concentration ends, all creatures within 15 feet of the mote must make a Dexterity saving throw as it explodes, taking 5d8 fire damage on failure or half as much on a success. </p>
        <p>The area of the explosion becomes difficult terrain for a number of rounds equal to your spellcasting ability modifier as it becomes coated with magma. All creatures that start their turn or enter the magma for the first time on their turn take 1d8 fire damage.</p>

        <p><b>At Higher Levels:</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
