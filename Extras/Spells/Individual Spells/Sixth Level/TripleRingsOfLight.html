        <h1>Triple Rings of Light</h1>
        <p><i>6th Level Golden Order Incantation</i></p>

        <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 Action</p>
        <p><b>Range:</b> Self (30ft Cone)</p>
        <p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>
        <p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

        <p>You create three large rings of light and toss them out, striking enemies they pass through. All creatures in a 30ft cone must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 6d6 radiant damage on a fail, or half as much on a success. The rings then return to you, forcing the save against creatures in the cone, still dealing 6d6 radiant damage.</p>

        <p><b>At Higher Levels:</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.</p>
        <p><b>Spell Lists:</b> Cleric, Druid</p>
