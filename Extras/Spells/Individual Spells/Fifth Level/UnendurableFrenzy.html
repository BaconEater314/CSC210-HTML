        <p>Whenever you drop concentration, you release a burst of frenzied flames all around you. All creatures within 20 feet of you must make an Intelligence saving throw, taking 6d6 fire damage on a fail or half as much on a success. A creature that takes damage gains madness buildup equal to 1/3 of the damage taken, and the caster gains 1d6 madness buildup.</p>
