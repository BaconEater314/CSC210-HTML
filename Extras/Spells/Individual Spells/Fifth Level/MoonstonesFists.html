        <p><i>5th Level Conjuration</i></p>

        <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 Action</p>
        <p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>
        <p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>
        <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 minute (Concentration)</p>

        <p>You conjure a pair of gauntleted spectral fists over the target’s hands, who have fine control over them. While the spell lasts, the target can use an action to make two melee attacks with either the caster’s spellcasting ability or their strength, dealing 4d8 force damage on a hit. The caster can make these attacks as part of the casting of the spell.</p>
        <p>If the target benefits from any sort of extra attack feature, they may make 1 additional attack per extra attack they have.</p>
        <p>Doing enough damage on one attack with these fists may knock a creature prone based on its size. If the required damage is met, the creature must make a Strength Saving Throw against the spellcaster’s Spell Save DC or be knocked prone.</p>
