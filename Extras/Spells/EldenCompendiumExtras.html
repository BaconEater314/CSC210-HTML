        <h1>Status Effects</h1>
        <h2>Scarlet Rot</h2>
        <p>Scarlet Rot is a dangerous affliction that whittles away the afflicted’s health. Scarlet Rot deals exclusively Scarlet Rot damage. A creature can withstand a number of Scarlet Rot buildup equal to its Constitution score + its level. When that number is reached or exceeded, it loses all Scarlet Rot buildup and is Poisoned. While poisoned this way, a creature takes 2d10 scarlet rot damage at the start of each of its turns for the next minute. Spells that remove the Poisoned condition do not remove Scarlet Rot unless they specify that they do so.</p>

        <h2>Blood Loss</h2>
        <p>Blood Loss is an affliction that builds up over time. A creature can withstand a number of Blood Loss buildup equal to its Constitution score + its level. When that number is reached or exceeded, it loses all Blood Loss buildup and loses 10% of its maximum hit points. A creature loses Blood Loss buildup upon receiving healing.</p>

        <h2>Madness</h2>
        <p>Madness is an extremely dangerous affliction that causes characters to go mad. A creature can withstand a number of Madness buildup equal to its Intelligence score + its level. When that number is reached or exceeded, it loses all Madness buildup and gains a form of short-term madness (pg. 259 of the DMG). A creature that has madness can make an Intelligence Saving throw against the DC of the effect that caused the madness at the end of each of its turns, ending the madness on a success.</p>
