            <p><b>Jump.</b> If the motorcycle moves at least 30 feet in a straight line, it can clear a distance of up to 60 feet when jumping over a chasm, ravine, or other gap. Each foot it clears on the jump costs a foot of movement.</p>
            <p><b>Prone Deficiency.</b> If the Motorcycle rolls over and falls prone, it can't right itself and is incapacitated until flipped upright.</p>
            <p><b>Stunt.</b> On its turn, the driver of the motorcycle can expend 10 feet of movement to perform one free vehicle stunt, such as a wheelie or a burnout. Before the stunt can be performed, the motorcycle must move at least 10 feet in a straight line. If the driver succeeds on a DC 10 Dexterity check using the bike's Dexterity, the stunt is successful. Otherwise, the driver is unable to perform the stunt and can't attempt another stunt until the start of its next turn. If the check fails by 5 or more, the motorcycle and all creatures riding it immediately fall prone as the bike wipes out and comes to a dead stop.</p>

            <p><b>Crushing Wheels.</b>The Truck can move through the space of any Large or smaller creature. When it does, the creature must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (3d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. If the creature was already prone, it takes an extra 16 (3d10) bludgeoning damage. This trait can't be used against a particular creature more than once each turn.</p>
