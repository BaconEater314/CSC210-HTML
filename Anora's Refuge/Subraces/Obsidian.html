        <h1><p>Dragonborn: Obsidian Dragonborn</p></h1>
        <p><i>The Obsidian Dragonborn, a long forgotten breed of Gem Dragonborn, have since made their return as a prevelant Dragonborn type in societies.</i></p>
        <p><i>Obsidian Dragonborn are strange, black colored Dragonborn, often mistaken for Black Dragonborn (Acid Breathers), with the biggest distinction being their sleek, shiny, black scales.</i></p>
        <p><i>Obsidian Dragonborn are Gem Dragonborn in nature, and thus gain the same benefits (detailed below) in addition to fire resistance like their Dragon counterparts.</i></p>

            <p><b>Breath Weapon:</b> When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magma in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 fire damage. This leaves a pool of magma that remains for 1d4 turns. All creatures (except you) that start their turn in it or enter it for the first time on their turn take fire damage equal to your proficiency bonus. You can use your Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p><b>Fire Resistance:</b> You have resistance to fire damage.</p>
            <p><b>Psionic Mind:</b> You can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don’t need to share a language with the creature, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.</p>
            <p><b>Gem Flight:</b> Starting at 5th level, you can use a bonus action to manifest spectral wings on your body. These wings last for 1 minute. For the duration, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. Once you use this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p><b>Languages:</b> You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.</p>
