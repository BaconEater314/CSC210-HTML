        <h1><b>Blood Hunter: Order of the Grimm Hand</b></h1>

        <!--Class flavor text-->
        <p><i>A strange group of Blood Hunters, still remaining, even after the destruction of the Grimm, creatures mentioned in brief by Anora. Though the Grimm may be gone, Anora finds it strange how these Blood Hunters can still draw on the long gone darkness for their deeds. Perhaps there now they draw on normal darkness, and just manifest it the same way, or maybe they find ways to channel the darkness from the ancient residue of the Grimm.</i></p>
        <p><i>Darkness always consumes the mind, however, and the though Order of the Grimm Hand stray close and attempt to shield their minds, sometimes the Grimm madness creeps in, for it is hard to truly repel it.</i></p>

        <h2><b>Grimm Touch</b></h2>
        <p>When you choose this Order at 3rd level, you gain the Rite of the Dead Crimson Rite. It does not count against your known Crimson Rites, and when you deal Necrotic damage with this Rite it ignores resistance. When you strike a Grimm with this Rite, you treat immunity as resistance.</p>

        <h2><b>Grimm Body</b></h2>
        <p>Additionally, when you choose this Order at 3rd level, you start to become one with the Grimm. You gain resistance to Necrotic damage. When you take Necrotic damage from activating your Crimson Rite, you can reduce the damage by your proficiency bonus.</p>
        
        <h2><b>Powerful Rite</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 7th level, you gain the ability to strengthen your Crimson Rites. When activating your Crimson Rite, you can deal an additional die of damage equal to your Hemocraft Die to yourself. Your weapon now deals 2 additional die of damage on a hit.</p>

        <h2><b>Brand of Grimm Madness</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 11th level, your Brand of Castigation inflicts Grimm Madness onto whomever it brands. Whenever the branded creature takes Necrotic or Psychic damage it must make an Intelligence Save against your Hemocraft Save DC, gaining madness buildup (Elden Compendium) equal to one half the damage taken.</p>

        <h2><b>Madness Protection</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 15th level, you’ve learned techniques to shield your mind from madness. You have advantage on saving throws against madness effects and resistance to damage sources that cause madness buildup.</p>

        <h2><b>Grimm Curse</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 18th level, you gain immunity to Necrotic damage. Whenever you deal Necrotic damage, you ignore immunity and resistance. You also gain the Blood Curse of the Grimm.</p>
