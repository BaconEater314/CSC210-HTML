        <h1><p>Chameleon</p></h1>
        <p><i>The Chameleon is a strange creature, much like the Changeling in a lot of ways, except more brightly colored. Anora revealed they were not originally from the old world, much like the Ardoni. They were originally slaves of an old empire, but now roam free.</i></p>
        <p><i>In their base form, Chameleons look roughly humanoid, with bright-colored hair of all colors, though mostly greens, blues, and purples. Their eyes are bright yellow, amber, and orange. They share skin colors with humans and age at the same rate, maturing at 18, but can live up to 450 years. Their most notable feature is a long, chameleon-like tail, which helps them change their appearance. The tails can either be scaly or smooth.</i></p>

        <div>
            <p><b>Creature Type:</b> You are a Fey</p>
            <p><b>Size:</b> You are medium or small. You choose the size when you select this race.</p>
            <p><b>Speed:</b> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>

            <p><b>Shapechanger:</b> As an action, you can change your appearance and voice. You determine the specifics of the changes, including your coloration, hair length, and sex. You can also adjust your height and weight, and can change your size between Medium and Small. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You can’t duplicate the appearance of an individual you’ve never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have. Your clothing and equipment aren’t changed by this trait, but can appear differently.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You stay in the new form until you use an action to revert to your true form or until you die.</li>
                <li>You can instead change the colors of your body to match the surroundings, possibly giving you advantage on stealth checks.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Shapeshifter Deception:</b> You gain proficiency in Deception. You have advantage on deception checks when deceiving creatures about your true identity.</p>
            <p><b>Limb Regrowth:</b> If you lose a limb, such as your arms, legs, or tail, it can slowly grow back over the course of 3d6 days. Consistent rest can help expedite this process.</p>

            <p><b>Darkvision:</b> You have a range of Darkvision out to 60 feet.</p>
            <p><b>Languages:</b> You can speak, read, and write Common, Sylvan.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Old Tribe Roles</h2>
        <p><i>Chameleons had roles within their clans a long long time ago, which stick with them to this day. Chameleons born nowadays gain an ability that one of their parents had based on their role.</i></p>
        <div>
            <p><b>Hunter</b></p>
            <p><i>You or one of your ancestors was a skilled hunter for the tribe, bringing in fresh animals for food.</i></p>

            <p><b>Ensaring Strike:</b> You know the Ensnaring Strike spell and can cast it without concentration a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per day. The spell’s DC uses your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (you choose when you pick this race).</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p><b>Shaman</b></p>
            <p><i>You or one of your ancestors was a Shaman for your tribe, able to create illusions to distract threats or spread stories and wisdom down to the younger tribe members.f</i></p>

            <p><b>Minor Illusion:</b> You know the Minor Illusion cantrip. The spell’s DC uses your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (you choose when you pick this race).</p>
            <p><b>Distracting Clone:</b> Additionally, when you reach 5th level, as a bonus action, you can create a temporary clone of yourself for 1 minute. It shares your AC and has hitpoints equal to 3 times your level. When created, it moves up to 30 feet away, and you turn invisible until the start of your next turn. You can command it to move freely on your turn. When you attack or cast a spell, it repeats your movements, appearing as if you were there. It remains until destroyed or you move 60 feet away from it. You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per day.</p>
            <p>A creature can use an action to make an investigation check on you or your clone against your spell save DC or 8+proficiency+dex mod. If they succeed, they discern whether you are real or the clone is fake.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p><b>Druid</b></p>
            <p><i>You or one of your ancestors was a druid in the tribe, someone who grew plants and loved all things natural about the world. Though these druids were not above defending themselves as well.</i></p>

            <p><b>Druidcraft:</b> You know the Druidcraft and Thorn Whip cantrip, the latter of which you can cast as a bonus action. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells (you choose when you pick this race).</p>
