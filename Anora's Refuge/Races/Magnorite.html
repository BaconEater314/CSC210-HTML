        <h1><p>Magnorite</p></h1>
        <p><i>A race not originally from the old world, the Magnorites are a race of rock type creatures. Very few of the had journeyed to our new world, and even fewer remained after the calamity. Magnorites are extremely rare, and most can be found around the Blackpits in a reclusive tribe.</i></p>
        <p><i>The Magnorite, a typically sullen, reclusive, and violent race (with rare exceptions) made of the earth and molten rock. Their skin is formed of rock and cracked in places, forming unique patterns much like the Ardoni, which reveal their lava-like blood. It is unclear if these cracks are unhealed wounds or genetic markings. Magnorites are strong, though terrible builders, often occupying patchwork buildings or old, stolen houses and caves.</i></p>
