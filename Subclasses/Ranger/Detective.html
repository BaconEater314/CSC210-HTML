        <h2><b>Eye for Tracking</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at level 3, you’ve learned how to expertly pick out tracks and follow creatures. Whenever you make a Wisdom (Survival) check to track creatures, treat a roll of 7 or lower on the d20 as an 8.</p>

        <h2><b>Eye for Detail</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at level 3, you can use a Bonus Action to make an Insight, Perception, or Investigation check.</p>
        
        <h2><b>Just One More Thing</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at level 7, whenever you succeed on a Persuasion or Intimidation check made to extract information from a creature, you may add a +1 bonus, up to your Wisdom Modifier, on all future Persuasion or Intimidation checks to extract information from that creature for the next 24 hours. If you fail a Persuasion or Intimidation check against that creature, you lose your bonus.</p>
