        <h1><b>Ranger: Slayer Conclave</b></h1>

        <!--Class flavor text-->
        <p><i>As a Slayer, you hunt dangerous prey that either have bounties or are dangerous and require more than the average hunter. Disciplined and dangerous, the Slayer hunts down their prey with lethal efficiency.</i></p>
        <p><b>Consider choosing the Favored Enemy feature over Favored Foe if you plan on choosing this subclass (Favored Foe is concentration, which cancels out Hunter’s Mark).</b></p>

        <!--Campaign setting this subclass is designed for-->
        <p><b>This subclass is designed for the Sapirian settings.</b></p>

        <!--Spellcasting table with extra spells for half/full casters-->
        <h2>Slayer Magic</h2>
        <p>Starting at 3rd level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Slayer Spells table. The spells count as Ranger spells for you, but don’t count against the number of Ranger spells you know.</p>

        <!--Subclass features. Add and remove number of features listed here as needed-->
        <h2><b>Bonus Proficiencies</b></h2>
        <p>You gain proficiency with the Lightning Revolver, Lightning Shotblaster, and Lightning Sharpshooter and ignore the loading property for them.</p>

        <h2><b>Hunter Killer</b></h2>
        <p>You’ve learned to mark your targets to better track and kill them. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the spell Hunter’s Mark a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You gain all expended uses after a long rest. Additionally, you can move up to 15 feet closer to the target when you cast this spell.</p>
        
        <h2><b>Doubletap</b></h2>
        <p>Your combat prowess has increased to a lethal efficiency. Starting at 7th level, you can double-fire your weapons. As part of the attack action, you can fire a second time if your gun has the appropriate number of bullets loaded. The second attack does not benefit from your dexterity modifier to the damage, and you can only do this once per turn.</p>

        <h2><b>Hatred and Discipline</b></h2>
        <p>As your skills grow, so does your hatred for your enemies and your battle discipline. You gain the following features at level 11:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><b>Hatred:</b> You pour your hatred into your attacks against your prey. When you hit a creature marked by Hunter’s Mark, you can choose to score a critical hit. You can do this once per short or long rest.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Discipline:</b> Your steel will has given you proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened and charmed.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2><b>Ultimate Hunter</b></h2>
        <p>You have become the ultimate hunter, able to hunt your prey with utmost efficiency. Starting at 15th level, you no longer have to concentrate on Hunter’s Mark, and it deals an additional d6 of damage on a hit. Additionally, you have advantage on all attack rolls against your prey.</p>
