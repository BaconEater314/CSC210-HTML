        <h1><b>Monk: Way of the Gun Fu</b></h1>

        <!--Class flavor text-->
        <p><i>A strange breed of martial artists, trained in the arts of pistols. The Gun Fu monks excel at blasting away and making impossible shots around corners. </i></p>

        <!--Campaign setting this subclass is designed for-->
        <p><b>This subclass is designed for the Upside setting.</b></p>

        <!--Subclass features. Add and remove number of features listed here as needed-->
        <h2><b>Firearm Proficiency</b></h2>
        <p>When you choose this archetype, you gain proficiency with simple firearms, and they count as Monk weapons for you. </p>

        <h2><b>Flurry of Bolts</b></h2>
        <p>Additionally, at 3rd level, when you use your Flurry of Blows Ki move, you can replace your unarmed strikes with ranged Firearm attacks.</p>
        
        <h2><b>Curve the Bullet</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 6th level, you can extend your Ki to make your shots curve around corners. When you make a ranged attack roll with a firearm, you can spend 1 ki point to ignore half or three-quarters cover. You can instead spend 2 ki points to hit creatures behind total cover, provided you know their whereabouts and the bolt has a path to reach them.</p>

        <h2><b>Level 11 Feature</b></h2>
        <p>The Upside is designed for lower level play. Thus, high level features have not been invented yet for this subclass.</p>

        <h2><b>Level 17 Feature</b></h2>
        <p>The Upside is designed for lower level play. Thus, high level features have not been invented yet for this subclass.</p>
