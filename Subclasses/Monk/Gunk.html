        <h1><b>Monk: Way of the Gung Ho</b></h1>

        <!--Class flavor text-->
        <p><i>Monks that follow the Way of the Gung Ho are often overzealous or enthusiastic people, often to the point of recklessness. They hate slow life and prefer to charge in, guns blazing, ready to take on the world and all its threats. Few things scare the Gung Ho, always living life on the edge.</i></p>
        <p><i>As a Gung Ho, you excel at running into battles as well as melee and ranged combat.</i></p>

        <!--Campaign setting this subclass is designed for-->
        <p><b>This subclass is designed for the early Sapirian settings.</b></p>

        <!--Subclass features. Add and remove number of features listed here as needed-->
        <h2><b>Bonus Proficiencies</b></h2>
        <p>When taking this tradition at third level, you gain proficiency with the Lightning Revolver and Railpistol, ignoring the loading property for both. Additionally, you ignore the disadvantage imposed by being in a creature’s melee range with these Lightning Firearms.</p>

        <h2><b>Charge In</b></h2>
        <p>As a Gung Ho, you love charging straight into battle, but still remaining aware of the danger. Starting at 3rd level, when you use Step of the Wind, you gain an additional move speed equal to 5 times your proficiency bonus.</p>
        <p>Additionally, when you do this, until the start of your next turn, any damage you take is reduced by your Dexterity Modifier (minimum 1) as you partially dodge attacks.</p>
        
        <h2><b>Zealous Strikes.</b></h2>
        <p>You’ve learned to channel overeagerness in battle into your strikes. Starting at 6th level, whenever you make an attack roll, you may spend one Ki point to gain advantage on that attack roll.</p>
        <p>Additionally, when you use your Flurry of Blows feature, you may replace your unarmed strikes with attacks with your Lightning Firearms.</p>

        <h2><b>Overeager</b></h2>
        <p>You can now channel your excessive enthusiasm for combat in order to act faster to get the upper hand. Starting at 11th level, you may now add your proficiency bonus to your initiative rolls. When rolling initiative, you may spend 2 Ki points to reroll, taking whichever result is higher.</p>

        <h2><b>Gun Ho.</b></h2>
        <p>You’ve mastered your firearms and can now truly go guns blazing. Starting at 17th level, as an attack action, you may spend 1-6 Ki points to fire your weapon, targeting a separate creature for each Ki point spent. If you are dual-wielding guns, you fire twice at each target.</p>
        <p>You can only do this once per turn and twice per rest.</p>
