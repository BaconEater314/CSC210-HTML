        <h1><b>Warlock: Pact of the Bar</b></h1>

        <!--Class flavor text-->
        <p><i>Warlocks have since gone out of style since it was made clear selling your soul wasn’t exactly appropriate. So they improvised, instead making a pact with the law, and became lawyers, because when you know the law well, you can exploit it.</i></p>

        <!--Campaign setting this subclass is designed for-->
        <p><b>This subclass is designed for the Upside setting.</b></p>

        <!--Spellcasting table with extra spells for half/full casters-->
        <h2>Expanded Spell List</h2>
        <p>The Bar lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.</p>

        <!--Subclass features. Add and remove number of features listed here as needed-->
        <h2><b>Firearm Proficiency</b></h2>
        <p>When you choose this subclass, you gain proficiency with simple firearms.</p>

        <h2><b>OBJECTION!</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 1st level, whenever a creature within 60 feet makes a d20 roll you do not like, you can use your reaction to shout “OBJECTION!” and force that creature to reroll, and must take the new roll. If the result is the same as it previously was, the DM/GM says “overruled” and continues with the game.</p>
        <p>You may do this a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier per day.</p>
        
        <h2><b>Defense Attorney</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 6th level, when not wearing armor, you can add your Charisma modifier to your AC.</p>

        <h2><b>Group Lawyer</b></h2>
        <p>Additionally, at 6th level you gain the ability to expertly help your clients in conversations. Whenever an ally within 30ft that can see and hear you makes a Charisma check, you automatically provide the help action by inserting yourself as their lawyer.</p>

        <h2><b>Level 10 Feature</b></h2>
        <p>The Upside is designed for lower level play. Thus, high level features have not been invented yet for this subclass.</p>

        <h2><b>Level 14 Feature (Ace Attorney)</b></h2>
