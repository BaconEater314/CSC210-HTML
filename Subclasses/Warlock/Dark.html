        <h1><b>Warlock: Pact of the Dark One</b></h1>

        <!--Class flavor text-->
        <p><i>You have made a pact with a being of darkness that lies beyond the touch of the mortal realm. A being that wishes for darkness to spread or to cause fear amongst the living and has chosen you as its host. While not necessarily inherently evil, this being enjoys feeding off fear.</i></p>
        <p><i>The origins of this being are unclear. Perhaps a creation of an evil mortal or a culmination of hate, cruelty, and malice gathered together over centuries.</i></p>

        <!--Campaign setting this subclass is designed for-->
        <p><b>This subclass is designed for the all settings.</b></p>

        <h2>Expanded Spell List</h2>
        <p>The Dark One lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.</p>

        <!--Subclass features. Add and remove number of features listed here as needed-->
        <h2><b>Vessel of Darkness</b></h2>
        <p>You have a vessel for your patron, a piece of jewelry that you keep on you at all times, for no one else should touch it. It is your precious…</p>
        <p>Your vessel can act as a spellcasting focus for your Warlock spells.</p>
        <p>While touching your vessel, you can invoke the following effects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Fear of the Dark One: </b>As a bonus action, you brandish your vessel as dark energy rolls off of it. A number of creatures within 30 feet equal to your proficiency bonus that can see you must make a Wisdom saving throw, becoming frightened of you for 1 minute. Affected creatures can repeat this save at the end of their turns, ending the effect on a success. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you take a short rest.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Dark Wrath: </b>Once during each of your turns when you hit with an attack roll, you can deal extra necrotic damage to the target equal to your proficiency bonus. This is doubled against targets frightened of you.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2><b>Gift of the Dark One</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 6th level, you begin to change, twisted by your Patron. Your eyes grow darker, and you age at a slower rate, as every 2 years is equal to 1 for you.</p>
        <p>You gain resistance to necrotic damage and gain the Devil’s Sight Invocation for free. This does not count against your known evocations, and if you already have this one, you may choose another. You also cannot be blinded by magic.</p>

        <h2><b>Infectious Fear</b></h2>
        <p>At 10th level, when you use Fear of the Dark One, the fear you strike in your enemies becomes infectious. If an enemy ends their turn within 10 feet of a feared target, they also must make the Wisdom saving throw, becoming frightened on a failure. This can spread to a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier, adding one for every feared enemy killed by you.</p>
        <p>Additionally, creatures that have taken damage from you in combat have disadvantage on the first Wisdom save against your Fear of the Dark One.</p>

        <h2><b>Feed off their Fear</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 14th level, you gain 1d6 Temporary Hit Points whenever a creature becomes frightened of you. These stack with each other but not with other sources of Temporary Hit Points.</p>
        <p>Additionally, you can expunge these hitpoints to fuel your next damaging attack. When you damage one creature, you can expend a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Warlock level to deal extra necrotic damage equal to the hit points spent. </p>
        <p>If you hit multiple creatures, you can only expend a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to half your Warlock level, dealing that damage to all creatures hit.</p>
