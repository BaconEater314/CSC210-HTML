        <!--Class flavor text-->
        <p><i>The Circle of the Deep is made of the denizens of the Underdark or explorers of its dark beauty and natural environments. These druids are often alone, preferring the company of the Underdark's strange creatures and open spaces.</i></p>

        <!--Campaign setting this subclass is designed for-->
        <p><b>This subclass is designed for all settings.</b></p>

        <!--Spellcasting table with extra spells for half/full casters-->
        <h2>(Subclass Name) Magic</h2>
        <p>Starting at 3rd level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Deep Spells table. The spells count as Druid spells for you, but don’t count against the number of Druid spells you know.</p>

        <!--Subclass features. Add and remove number of features listed here as needed-->
        <h2><b>Enhanced Darkvision</b></h2>
        <p>You are accustomed to the dank and dark, and so your vision is acutely adjusted to such environments. When you choose this subclass, you gain an additional 60 feet of darkvision, adding onto any you already may have. Half of your maximum darkvision treats dark light as bright light.</p>

        <h2><b>From the Depths</b></h2>
        <p>Not all denizens of the Underdark are nice, often seeing even you as prey as such you are accustomed to hiding from them. You gain proficiency in Stealth and gain advantage on Stealth and Survival checks while underground.</p>
        <p>Additionally, you retain all your subclass features while Wildshaped, regardless if the creature has those features or not.</p>

        <h2><b>Sight of the Deep</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 6th level, you gain the ability to “see” as Underdark creatures do by mimicking their methods. As long as you can hear, you can echolocate, giving you Blindsight out to 30 feet. Additionally, if you are touching the earth with bare skin, you can feel the vibrations in the earth of passing creatures, giving you Tremorsense out to 30 feet. Wearing coverings reduces this to only 15 feet.</p>

        <h2><b>Creature of the Deep</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 10th level, you can now Wildshape into many denizens of the Underdark. Your Wildshape is no longer restricted to Beasts (but not Humanoids) as long as it lives in the Underdark and its CR is equal to or lower than one-third of your druid level, rounded appropriately.</p>

        <h2><b>One with the Deep</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 14th level, your extra senses from Sight of the Deep are doubled, as well as gaining resistance to Poison and Cold damage as your body naturally resists the toxins and cold of the Underdark.</p>
        <p>Additionally, you gain a Climb and Swim speed equal to your move speed, and you now ignore difficult terrain while underground.</p>
