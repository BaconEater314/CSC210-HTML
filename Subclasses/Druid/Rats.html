        <h2>Circle Spells</h2>
        <p>Your mystical connection to the Sewers infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level, you gain access to circle spells.</p>
        <p>Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p>

        <!--Subclass features. Add and remove number of features listed here as needed-->
        <h2><b>Swarm Shape</b></h2>
        <p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, when you Wildshape you can now turn into swarms of creatures of appropriate CR of your Wildshape table. While Wildshaped as a swarm, you can cast your circle spells.</p>

        <h2><b>Vermintide</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 6th level, the power of your swarms grows. The CR for swarms you can Wildshape into equals 1/3rd your level (rounded down). Additionally while Wildshaped your attack bonus for attacks equals your Spell Attack Modifier or the creature’s attack bonus, whichever is higher.</p>
        
        <h2><b>Optional Feature: Electric Current</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 6th level, you gain resistance to Lightning damage while Wildshaped.</p>

        <h2><b>10th Level Feature</b></h2>
        <p>The Upside is designed for lower level play. Thus, high level features have not been invented yet for this subclass.</p>

        <h2><b>14th Level Feature</b></h2>
        <p>The Upside is designed for lower level play. Thus, high level features have not been invented yet for this subclass.</p>
