        <h1><b>Blackfire Domain</b></h1>

        <!--Class flavor text-->
        <p><i>Those who draw on the power of Morgana, demigod of darkness and destruction. Blackfire clerics aren’t inherently evil, though something is to be said of those who worship the Vieled Lady or the Lady of Nightmares, as she is often called. Blackfire clerics are often a strange bunch, reclusive in nature and frequently are at odds with those of the Starfire Domain.</i></p>

        <p><b>This subclass is designed for the Anora's Refuge setting.</b></p>

        <h2>Blackfire Magic</h2>
        <p>Starting at 3rd level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Blackfire Spells table. The spells count as Cleric spells for you, but don’t count against the number of Cleric spells you know.</p>
        <p>Certain spells are listed in the <a href="Spells and Weapons/Elden.html" target="_blank.html"> Elden Compendium </a>. Check that location for unfamiliar spells.</p>

        <!--Subclass features. Add and remove number of features listed here as needed-->
        <h2><b>Bonus Proficiencies</b></h2>
        <p>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons. Additionally, you learn the Catch Flame cantrip (listed in the Elden Compendium). This spell deals exclusively Black Fire damage for you.</p>

        <h2><b>Soul Siphon</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at level 1, you syphon the life of those who burn in your black flames. Whenever you deal Black Fire damage to a creature, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier. These hitpoints do not stack and last for 1 hour.</p>

        <h2><b>Channel Divinity: Corrupted Flames</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at level 2, you can use your Channel Divinity to twist fire and radiance into black fire, a darker and deadlier substance.</p>
        <p>As a reaction to a spell that deals Fire or Radiant damage cast by a creature you can see within 60ft of you, or as part of the casting of one of your Fire or Radiant damage-dealing spells, you change all the damage to Black Fire damage. The spell then does additional damage equal to your Cleric Level.</p>

        <h2><b>Black Shield</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at level 6, you can shield creatures from magical damage. As a bonus action, you can grant a creature within 60ft that you can see (including yourself) temporary hit points equal to your Cleric Level. While a creature has these temporary hit points, they have resistance to magical damage, and the next time that creature is hit with a crowd control effect (stunned, grappled), the effect is canceled and the temporary hit points vanish entirely.</p>
        <p>You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per day.</p>

        <h2><b>Divine Strike</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at level 8, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with the dark fires of Morgana. Once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 Black Fire damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>

        <h2><b>Supreme Siphon</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at level 17, whenever you deal Black Fire damage to a creature, you no longer gain temporary hit points and instead regain a number of hit points equal to your Wisdom Modifier.</p>
