        <!--Class flavor text-->
        <p><i>Time Domain Clerics are guardians of time, worshippers of the gods, and the flow of time itself. A Time Cleric is able to bend time to their will to their own or their allies' benefit and can take advantage of their ability to look ahead to stop their foes.</i></p>

        <!--Campaign setting this subclass is designed for-->
        <p><b>This subclass is designed for the Sapirian settings.</b></p>

        <!--Spellcasting table with extra spells for half/full casters-->
        <h2>Time Magic</h2>
        <p>Starting at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Time Domain Spells table. The spells count as Cleric spells for you, but don’t count against the number of Cleric spells you know.</p>

        <!--Subclass features. Add and remove number of features listed here as needed-->
        <h2><b>Bonus Proficiencies</b></h2>
        <p>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons and heavy armor.</p>

        <h2><b>Timeless One</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 1st level, you age at half the rate you normally do, and are immune to aging effects. Additionally, any effects that would reduce your hit point maximum are halved.</p>
        
        <h2><b>Channel Divinity: Rewind Time</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to rewind time in small amounts. When a creature other than you within 60 feet makes a d20 roll, you can use your reaction, expending a Channel Divinity charge to rewind them slightly, forcing a reroll. A creature that rerolls still retains the modifiers of the roll (such as advantage, disadvantage, sharpshooter, or great weapon master) and must take the new roll.</p>

        <h2><b>Prethinking</b></h2>
        <p>Your concept of time is slightly altered, allowing you to react faster to threats, even before they have happened or were ever conceived. Starting at 6th level, you may add your Wisdom Modifier (minimum of 1) to your initiative rolls. You also gain a +1 to AC while not incapacitated, which becomes a +2 at 14th level.</p>
        <p>Additionally, you may use Rewind Time on yourself.</p>

        <h2><b>Timeless Strike</b></h2>
        <p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to act faster when you attack, allowing you to get more hits in. When you take the attack action, you may now attack twice instead of once. At 14th level, your attacks deal an additional 1d8 psychic damage.</p>

        <h2><b>Master of Time</b></h2>
        <p>You have become a master of time, immune to all its effects. Starting at 17th level, you no longer age and are immune to hit point reduction effects. Additionally, when a creature ends its turn within 60 feet of you, you can use your Rewind Time Channel Divinity to force it to retake its entire turn.</p>
        
        <h2><b>Shatter Time</b></h2>
        <p>Time bends to your will. Also starting at 17th level, you gain immunity to the Time Stop spell, meaning when another creature casts that spell, you may still take your turn as if you had cast it as well, ending the spell entirely for both if you fulfill the conditions for ending the spell. Additionally, Time Stop is added to your spell list as a Cleric spell for you, and you can cast it once per day without expending a spell slot.</p>
