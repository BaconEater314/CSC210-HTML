        <p>Starting at 1st, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Starfire Spells table. The spells count as Cleric spells for you, but don’t count against the number of Cleric spells you know.</p>
        <p>Certain spells are listed in the <a href="Spells and Weapons/Elden.html" target="_blank.html"> Elden Compendium </a>. Check that location for unfamiliar spells.</p>

        <h2><b>Bonus Proficiencies</b></h2>
        <p>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons.</p>

        <h2><b>Radiant Spear</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at level 1, you gain the ability to throw out a divine spear at your enemies. As an action, make a ranged spell attack roll against a creature you can see within 60 feet, ignoring disadvantage from being in the melee range of other creatures. On a hit, deal 1d8 + Wisdom modifier Radiant damage. When you reach level 6, this ability benefits from your Divine Strike, and from Crossed Flames at level 17 (targets all creatures of your choice in a 15ft cone originating from a point within 60ft).</p>
        
        <h2><b>Channel Divinity: Starfire Spellblade</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at level 2, you can use your Channel Divinity to enchant weapons with divine power.</p>
        <p>As a bonus action, target a weapon you can see within 60ft. When a creature is hit with that weapon, it takes additional fire and radiant damage equal to your proficiency bonus. The weapon retains this ability for a number of successful strikes equal to your Wisdom Modifier.</p>

        <h2><b>Celestial Blessing</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at level 6, you can grant your allies a blessing, healing their injuries and boosting their resolve.</p>
        <p>As a bonus action, target a creature you can see within 60ft. They regain a number of d8s worth of hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. The creature’s move speed is also increased by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.</p>
        <p>You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per day.</p>

        <h2><b>Divine Strike</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at level 8, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with the radiance of Melena. Once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 Fire or Radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>

        <h2><b>Crossed Flames</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at level 17, your weapon attacks spread divine flames. Whenever you make a melee weapon attack, you can choose to target all creatures of your choice in a 15-foot cone, applying both your weapon’s damage and twice your divine strike damage on a hit.</p>
