        <!--Class flavor text-->
        <p><i>The Battle Medic is a flavor of Cleric that relies on their allies to do the heavy lifting by keeping them alive to do so. Battle Medics can heal and support their team, or themselves, and are willing to move through danger to save lives.</i></p>

        <!--Campaign setting this subclass is designed for-->
        <p><b>This subclass is designed for the Upside setting.</b></p>

        <h2>Battle Medic Magic</h2>
        <p>Starting at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Battle Medic Spells table. The spells count as Cleric spells for you, but don’t count against the number of Cleric spells you know.</p>

        <!--Subclass features. Add and remove number of features listed here as needed-->
        <h2><b>Bonus Proficiencies</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at level 1, you learn the Spare the Dying cantrip. It doesn’t count against your cantrips known, and you can cast it as a bonus action. Additionally, when an ally you can see drops to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to move up to your move speed towards them.</p>

        <h2><b>Channel Divinity: Staunch the Bleeding</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at level 2, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal horrible injuries.</p>
        <p>As an action, you touch a creature and heal a critical injury of your choice that was affecting them, restoring a number of hit points equal to twice your Cleric level. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on an Undead or Construct.</p>

        <h2><b>Stayin Alive</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at level 6, when a creature within 60ft of you fails a Death Saving Throw, you can use your reaction to make them succeed instead. You can use this a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus per day.</p>

        <h2><b>Extra Attack</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at level 8, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. At 14th level, you can attack three times whenever you take the Attack action.</p>

        <h2><b>Supreme Medic</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at level 17, whenever you use your Channel Divinity: Staunch the Bleeding, the target heals from all Critical Injuries it is suffering. Additionally, it can heal over half its hit point maximum.</p>
