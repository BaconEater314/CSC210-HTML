        <!--Class flavor text-->
        <p><i>Born this way, or cursed, you were given the dark powers that originate from the Creatures of Grimm. You draw on this dark energy to cast spells, a power that slowly corrupts the mind, heart, and soul.</i></p>

        <!--Campaign setting this subclass is designed for-->
        <p><b>This subclass is designed for the early Sapirian setting.</b></p>

        <h2>Grimm Soul Quirks</h2>
        <p>When you choose this subclass, you can pick from or roll on the Grimm Soul table to create a quirk for your character. These effects are purely cosmetic, though they may turn some heads.</p>

        <h2>Grimm Magic</h2>
        <p>You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Grimm Spells table. Each spell counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know. These spells can’t be replaced when you gain a level in this class.</p>
        <p>Additionally, you gain access to the Grimm Claws cantrip. This does not count against your cantrip total.</p>

        <h2><b>Necrotic Soul</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 1st level, you gain resistance to necrotic damage, similar to lesser Grimm. While not weak to radiant damage like the Grimm, it does give you an ill feeling.</p>
        <p>When you hit level 15 in this class, the necrotic resistance becomes immunity.</p>
        
        <h2><b>Grimm Sense</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 6th level, you can sense and inflame the negative emotions of nearby creatures using sorcery points. As a bonus action, you can create the following effects by surging the negative emotions in a sentient creature:</p>

                <td><b>Fear: </b>Target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you for 1 minute. Targets can repeat the save at the end of their turn, ending the effect on a success.</td>

            <tr>
                <td>3</td>
                <td><b>Anger: </b>Target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or target their nearest ally with one of their attacks on their turn. If there is no ally in range, they forgo that attack.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td><b>Recklessness: </b>Target gains advantage on all attack rolls, but all attack rolls against it have advantage until the end of its next turn.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td><b>Lust: </b>Target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be charmed for the next minute. This effect ends if the target takes damage. When it ends, the target knows it was charmed.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <h2><b>Heart of Darkness</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 14th level, you can cast Darkness from your spell list without expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your Charisma Modifier per long rest and can see in all magical darkness. When you end your turn in magical darkness, you gain 1d10 temporary hit points.</p>
        <p>Additionally, you may now convert temporary and normal hit points into sorcery points. You must extinguish 10 hitpoints to regain one sorcery point. You can do this a number of times equal to your Constitution Modifier per short or long rest.</p>

        <h2><b>Grimm Awakening</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 18th level, you can temporarily become one with the Grimm. As a bonus action on your turn, your skin becomes dark, black, and leathery, and bone plates spike from your skin, giving you a +2 to AC. You also grow large Nevermore wings, giving you a fly speed equal to your walking speed, and your eyes turn to a burning orange, giving you Truesight out to 120 feet.</p>
        <p>Additionally, while in this form, Grimm will refuse to attack you, and you roll with advantage when using your Grimm Claws cantrip, which will always do maximum damage. Your Grimm summons are also empowered, doubling their hitpoints and allowing them to make an extra attack.</p>
        <p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 7 sorcery points to use it again.</p>
