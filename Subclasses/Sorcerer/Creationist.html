        <!--Class flavor text-->
        <p><i>Much like bards, these Sorcerers draw their powers from creation and art. Sorcerers born with this power often draw their magic into being, be it with pencils, pens, or paint, though some may choose to channel the weave into tapestries of magic or sculptures of power.</i></p>

        <h2>Creationist Magic</h2>
        <p>Starting at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Creationist Spells table. The spells count as Sorcerer spells for you, but don’t count against the number of Sorcerer spells you know.</p>

        <!--Subclass features. Add and remove number of features listed here as needed-->
        <h2><b>Tools of Creation</b></h2>
        <p>Beginning at level 1, you gain proficiency with one of the following: Weaver’s Tools, Painter’s Tools, Calligrapher’s Supplies, or Carpenter’s Tools. These tools can be used as your spellcasting focus.</p>

        <h2><b>Artist's Focus</b></h2>
        <p>When you begin casting spells this way, your art’s message expresses itself through your magic. When you cast a spell through your tools, you can give it one of the following benefits: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Bold:</b> +1 to the spell attack roll or -1 to a creature’s saving throw against your spell. You can do this before or after a roll is made, but before you know the result. This becomes a +2/-2 at level 9, and a +3/-3 at level 15.</li>
            <li><b>Powerful:</b> You deal additional damage equal to your Charisma modifier to one target of the spell. You can target an additional creature with this at level 9 and a third at level 15.</li>
            <li><b>Subtle:</b> The spell has no verbal components.</li>
            <li><b>Vivid:</b> The spell is brighter and louder, granting you advantage on Intimidation or Performance checks made until the end of your next turn. This lasts for 1 minute at 9th level.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per day.</p>

        <h2><b>Slow and Steady</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 6th level, you can spend more time creating your spells to make them more powerful. If you take extra time to cast a spell, such as Summon Beast, it counts as one level higher than the spell slot you used to cast it.</p>
        <p>The casting time is increased based on the original time. 1 Action becomes 1 minute, 1 minute becomes 10 minutes, and 10 minutes becomes 1 hour. Spells that have a base casting time of 1 hour cannot be cast this way.</p>
        
        <h2><b>Living Medium</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 14th level, you can project your artistic tools of choice. As a bonus action, you can project your spellcasting focus up to 30ft away from you, where it floats for 1 minute. You can move it up to your move speed on your turn to an unoccupied space within 30ft of you. While your focus is out, you can cast spells through it as if you were in its space, and you add your Charisma modifier to the first damage roll you make per turn.</p>
        <p>You can do this a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus per day.</p>

        <h2><b>Eternal Masterpiece</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 18th level, your greatest works refuse to fade. When you cast a 5th-level spell or lower, you can choose to make it permanent. It loses its concentration requirement if it has one, and its duration becomes “until dispelled.”</p>
        <p>You may have only one Eternal Masterpiece active at a time. While it is active, you lose the spell slot used to cast it until it is dispelled, and you cannot concentrate on any higher-level spells if it originally required concentration.</p>
        <p>You can create one Eternal Masterpiece per day, ending the active one if you create another.</p>
