        <h1><b>Wizard: School of Tactical Breaching</b></h1>

        <!--Class flavor text-->
        <p><i>Spellbooks are for pussies. Guns are where it’s at, and you excel at firearm magic. You bet your ass they’re going to piss themselves when the Tactical Breach Wizards break down their doors and unleash fireball hell.</i></p>

        <!--Campaign setting this subclass is designed for-->
        <p><b>This subclass is designed for the Sapirian settings.</b></p>

        <!--Subclass features. Add and remove number of features listed here as needed-->
        <h2><b>Spell Shot</b></h2>
        <p>When you adopt this tradition at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with the Lightning Revolver. Once per day, you can inscribe up to 6 of your prepared spells onto bolts (including cantrips) that take an Action or a Bonus Action to cast. When you cast one of those spells, you can instead fire it from your gun, choosing a point within 60ft for the spell to originate from. This also removes the Verbal components for the spell, if it has them.</p>
        <p>Additionally, normal shots with the Lightning Revolver use your Intelligence Modifier if it is higher than your Dexterity.</p>

        <h2><b>Smoke Bomb.</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to toss out a smoke bomb. You can cast Fog Cloud as a bonus action for free a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest. You may still cast it using a spell slot as well. When casting it this way, the radius increases by 10 feet, and you can see unobstructed inside it.</p>
        <p>Fog Cloud cast in this way can also surprise enemies.</p>
        
        <h2><b>Tactical Breach</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 6th level, your spells and attacks deal double damage to objects and structures. Those doors never stood a chance…</p>

        <h2><b>Spellshot Roulette</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 10th level, you can spin the chamber on your revolver to cast a random spell assigned to a bullet. When you inscribe your Spell Shots, assign each spell a number between 1 and 6 with no duplicates. When you choose to spin the barrel roll a d6, casting the spell assigned to the number rolled. You choose where to cast the spell as normal. If it triggers a saving throw, creatures of your choice suffer a penalty equal to your Intelligence Modifier to the saving throw. If it triggers a spell attack roll, you may add your Intelligence Modifier to the damage roll.</p>
        <p>If you cannot cast the spell (including upcasting), you must roll again until you get a spell you can cast. Rolling again this way does not use up any of your maximum uses.</p>
        <p>You may do this a number of times equal to your Intelligence Modifier per day.</p>

        <h2><b>Break Down the Wall</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 14th level, you excel at breaching structures. You can cast Disintegrate once per day. When casting this spell on a Huge or Larger object/creation of magical force, it now removes up to a 30ft cube portion of it (your choice).</p>
