        <h2>Tenents of the Radiant</h2>
        <p><b>Life Before Death. </b>The Radiant seeks to defend life, always. He never kills unnecessarily and never risks his own life for frivolous reasons. Living is harder than dying. The Radiant's duty is to live.</p>
        <p><b>Strength Before Weakness. </b>All men are weak at some time in their lives. The Radiant protects those who are weak and uses his strength for others. Strength does not make one capable of rule; it makes one capable of service.</p>
        <p><b>Journey Before Destination. </b>There are always several ways to achieve a goal. Failure is preferable to winning through unjust means. Protecting ten innocents is not worth killing one. In the end, all men die. How you lived will be far more important than what you accomplished.</p>

        <!--Spellcasting table with extra spells for half/full casters-->
        <h2>Oath Spells</h2>
        <p>Starting at 3rd level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Oath of the Radiant Spells table. The spells count as Paladin spells for you, but don’t count against the number of Paladin spells you know.</p>

        <h2><b>Channel Divinity</b></h2>
        <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Shardblade: </b>As a bonus action, you can summon a mystical blue weapon for one hour. This weapon can be any melee weapon you are proficient with that has a blade. This weapon has a +1 to all attack and damage rolls, deals an extra 1d6 damage, and is magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance. The bonus and damage becomes +2 and 1d8 at 11th level, and +3 and 1d10 at 17th level.</p>
                <p>Alternatively, you may add this bonus to your currently equipped weapon, gaining the bonus damage and magical property if it has none. It takes whatever bonus is higher.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Stormlight Lashings: </b> As a bonus action on your turn, you gain a flying speed equal to 5 times your proficiency bonus for one minute. However, you can only move in one direction at a time on your turn and must use a bonus action to change directions mid-flight. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2><b>Aura of Radiance</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you gain resistance to radiant damage. Additionally, when you land a hit and smite, a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) will deal additional radiant damage equal to your proficiency bonus on their next attack. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 ft.</p>
        
        <h2><b>Stormlight Bond</b></h2>
        <p>Your power as a Knight Radiant has grown, allowing you to grant your allies the same powers. At 15th level, when you use any of your Channel Divinity features, all allies within 120 ft gain the same benefits you gain.</p>

        <h2><b>Knight Radiant</b></h2>
        <p>You are a paragon of radiance, a shining example of what it means to be a Knight Radiant. At 20th level, your channel divinity effects on you and your allies are permanent, and you no longer need to use your bonus action to change direction for your lashings. </p>
        <p>You can use your channel divinity as a bonus action to now either restore a 5th-level or lower spell slot or to double the range of your paladin auras and the creatures affected by your aura of radiance for one minute.</p>
