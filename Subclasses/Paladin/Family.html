        <ul>
            <li><p><b>Ice em: </b>As a bonus action, target a creature within 30ft, designating it as the trash, and an ally you can see the disposer. For the next minute, that ally has advantage on all attack rolls made against the target creature. If that ally lands the killing blow on the “trash,” they gain temporary hitpoints equal to your Charisma modifier.</p></li>
