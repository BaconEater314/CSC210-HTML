        <!--Subclass features. Add and remove number of features listed here as needed-->
        <h2><b>Channel Divinity</b></h2>
        <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><b>Ice em: </b>As a bonus action, target a creature within 30ft, designating it as the trash, and an ally you can see the disposer. For the next minute, that ally has advantage on all attack rolls made against the target creature. If that ally lands the killing blow on the “trash,” they gain temporary hitpoints equal to your Charisma modifier.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Commanding Presence:</b> As bonus action, you can exude a formidable presence. For the next minute, the first time you hit a creature on your turn, it must make a Wisdom Saving Throw or become Frightened of you until the end of its next turn. When you score a critical hit, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2><b>Aura of Respect</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 7th level, your position in this family grants you respect, and your enemies know it. You have an aura that extends out to 10ft. Your enemies have disadvantage on contested checks against creatures of your choice inside your aura. Additionally, creatures of your choice gain a bonus to Charisma checks made while within 10ft of you equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>
        <p>When you reach 18th level in this class, this aura extends out to 30ft.</p>
        
        <h2><b>Reputation of Iron</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 15th level, you’ve earned the reputation you’ve been given. While above 50% of your maximum hitpoints, you have resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing from non-magical attacks, as well as Lightning damage.</p>
        <p>Additionally, creatures with a CR lower or equal to half your level have disadvantage on attack rolls made against you unless there is another ally of theirs within 5ft of you.</p>
        
        <h2><b>Blood In, Blood Out</b></h2>
        <p>Additionally, starting at 15th level, your loyalty to your family knows no bounds. Whenever a creature drops ally you can see to 0 hit points, you gain advantage on all attack rolls made against the creature for the next minute.</p>
        <p>If that creature kills an ally of yours, the next attack made against it is garunteed to deal critical damage if it hits.</p>
        
        <h2><b>Family Above All</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 20th level, you have reached the pinnacle of family bond and camaraderie. As an action, you swear the ultimate oath to your family. Choose up to 5 allies you can see that are considered “Family”, bonding with them. While bonded, all of you gain the following benefits while within 60ft of you for the next minute:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.</li>
            <li>Deal an additional 1d6 Radiant or Necrotic damage (your choice) on a hit.</li>
            <li>The first time they are reduced to 0 hit points, they are instead drop to 1 hit point.</li>
            <li>Whenever you hit a creature with a Divine Smite, your family members can make a melee attack as a reaction.</li>
        </ul>
