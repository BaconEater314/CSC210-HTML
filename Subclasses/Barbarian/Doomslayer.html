        <h1><b>Barbarian: Path of the Doom Sayer</b></h1>

        <!--Class flavor text-->
        <p><i>You follow the path of the mythical Demon Slayer, a warrior of unfettered might and rage on the battlefield. Death was his work, now it is yours. Rip and tear, until it is done.</i></p>

        <!--Campaign setting this subclass is designed for-->
        <p><b>This subclass is designed for the Sapirian settings.</b></p>

        <!--Subclass features. Add and remove number of features listed here as needed-->
        <h2><b>Super Shotgun</b></h2>
        <p>When you choose this path, you gain proficiency with the Lightning Shotblaster and ignore the loading property for them. For attacks made within its short range, you may add your rage damage while raging and use your strength in place of dexterity.</p>
        <p>Additionally, attacks made with the Shotblaster within melee range of other creatures do not have disadvantage.</p>

        <h2><b>Glory Kill</b></h2>
        <p>Your rage now grants you unfettered strength and overwhelming anger directed towards your enemies. Whenever you reduce an enemy creature that is 2 sizes larger than you or smaller’s HP below your Barbarian level + your strength modifier with a melee or shotblaster attack, you can us a bonus action or attack to execute them in a bloody/gory fashion if you are within 5 feet of them. Doing this gives you an additional 10 move speed for your current turn and the next turn.</p>
        <p>You cannot execute a creature that has Legendary Actions or Legendary Resistances unless the DM/GM allows it. For example, the DM/GM may allow you to execute a boss if it is the final enemy on the board.</p>

        <h2><b>Meathook</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 6th level, you gain a hook and chain mounted to the bottom of your shotgun. As a bonus action on your turn or when you rage, you can fire the hook at an enemy within 30 feet. Make a ranged attack roll (using strength), dealing 1d4 + Strength Modifier piercing damage on a hit. You may then reel yourself in, moving up to 30 feet closer to the target.</p>

        <h2><b>Blood Fists</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 10th level, while raging, you can use a bonus action to enter a berserk state. While berserk, you must use your unarmed strikes, which deal 1d10 damage as well as double your rage bonus. In order to keep berserk, you must deal damage to an enemy creature, otherwise it ends, and you must start a new rage before using this feature.</p>
        <p>At 17th level, you may make a third attack while berserk</p>

        <h2><b>Feature</b></h2>

        <h2><b>Endless Slaughter</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 14th level, your glory kills increase the damage you deal. For every glory kill you perform, your rage damage bonus increases by 1. When you stop raging, you retain half of the bonus damage gained, which goes away when you long rest.</p>
