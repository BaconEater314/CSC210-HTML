        <h1><b>Barbarian: Path of the Knuckle Duster</b></h1>

        <!--Class flavor text-->
        <p><i>The Knuckle Duster Barbarian, a form of warrior that emerged from the illegal pit fights, where fighters brawled it out with just their fists or with good ol brass knuckles. These Barbarians excel at using their fists to solve problems, punching their way through anything, as long as it gets the job done. And what’s a couple of bruises along the way, eh? Not like these guys can’t take a punch.</i></p>

        <!--Campaign setting this subclass is designed for-->
        <p><b>This subclass is designed for the Upside setting. However, it fits in other settings, removing the Bolt Resistance feature for non-lighting-based firearm settings.</b></p>

        <!--Subclass features. Add and remove number of features listed here as needed-->
        <h2><b>Power Fists</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 3rd level, your unarmed strikes deal a d6 Bludgeoning damage on a hit. When using Brass Knuckles, this becomes a d8.</p>
        <p>Additionally, you can make an unarmed strike as a bonus action after you take the attack action.</p>

        <h2><b>Bolt Resistance</b></h2>
        <p>Additionally, when you choose this subclass, you gain resistance to lightning damage when you rage.</p>
        
        <h2><b>All In</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 6th level, you can sacrifice some of your defense to focus on your unarmed strikes. When you enter a rage, you can choose to lose up to your Constitution modifier from your Unarmored Defense, and gain a bonus to your unarmed and brass knuckle attack and damage rolls equal to the AC lost.</p>
        <p>You can only do this if you are not wearing armor.</p>

        <h2><b>Level 10 Feature</b></h2>
        <p>The Upside is designed for lower level play. Thus, high level features have not been invented yet for this subclass.</p>

        <h2><b>Level 14 Feature</b></h2>
        <p>The Upside is designed for lower level play. Thus, high level features have not been invented yet for this subclass.</p>
