        <h1><b>Blood Hunter: Order of the Grimm Hand</b></h1>

        <!--Class flavor text-->
        <p><i>A new group of Blood Hunters, originating from southern Duria where the Grimm Bulwark meets No Man’s Land. These warriors seek to understand and defeat the creatures of darkness, a strategy that can extend to other opponents. Often these Blood Hunters spend weeks roaming the deserted planes, studying and slaying.</i></p>
        <p><i>Darkness always consumes the mind, however, and the though Order of the Grimm Hand stray close and attempt to shield their minds, sometimes the Grimm madness creeps in, for it is hard to truly repel it.</i></p>

        <!--Subclass features. Add and remove number of features listed here as needed-->
        <h2><b>Grimm Touch</b></h2>
        <p>When you choose this Order at 3rd level, you gain the Rite of the Dead Crimson Rite. It does not count against your known Crimson Rites, and when you deal Necrotic damage with this Rite it ignores resistance. When you strike a Grimm with this Rite, you treat immunity as resistance.</p>

        <h2><b>Grimm Body</b></h2>
        <p>Additionally, when you choose this Order at 3rd level, you start to become one with the Grimm. You gain resistance to Necrotic damage. When you take Necrotic damage from activating your Crimson Rite, you can reduce the damage by your proficiency bonus.</p>
        
        <h2><b>Powerful Rite</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 7th level, you gain the ability to strengthen your Crimson Rites. When activating your Crimson Rite, you can deal an additional die of damage equal to your Hemocraft Die to yourself. Your weapon now deals 2 additional die of damage on a hit.</p>
        <p>When you reach 15th level in this class you can roll 3 dice.</p>

        <h2><b>Brand of Grimm Madness</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 11th level, your Brand of Castigation inflicts Grimm Madness onto whomever it brands. Whenever the branded creature takes Necrotic or Psychic damage it must make an Intelligence Save against your Hemocraft Save DC, gaining madness buildup (Elden Compendium) equal to one half the damage taken.</p>

        <h2><b>Madness Protection</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 15th level, you’ve learned techniques to shield your mind from madness. You have advantage on saving throws against madness effects and resistance to damage sources that cause madness buildup.</p>

        <h2><b>Grimm Curse</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 18th level, you gain immunity to Necrotic damage. Whenever you deal Necrotic damage, you ignore immunity and resistance. You also gain the Blood Curse of the Grimm.</p>
        
        <h3>Blood Curses</h3>
        <h4>Blood Curse of Apathy.</h4>
        <p><b>Prerequisite: 15th Level, Order of the Grimm Hand</b></p>
        <p>When you damage a creature with your Crimson Rite, you can curse them with Apathy. The target must make a Constitution Saving Throw against your Hemocraft Save DC or take a level of exhaustion.</p>

        <h4>Blood Curse of the Grimm</h4>
        <p><b>Prerequisite: 18th Level, Order of the Grimm Hand</b></p>
        <p>When a creature that isn’t a construct within 30ft of you dies, you can cause its body to mutate into an Apathy Grimm under your control for 1 minute. When it uses it’s exhaustion ability, it uses your Hemocraft Save DC.</p>
