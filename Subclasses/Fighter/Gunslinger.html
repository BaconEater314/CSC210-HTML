        <h1><b>Fighter: Gunslinger</b></h1>

        <!--Class flavor text-->
        <p><i>The Gunslinger is a mobile warrior who lives for combat and the thrill of danger. Quick on the draw and master of the gun, the Gunslinger is the ultimate road warrior or vagabond.</i></p>

        <!--Campaign setting this subclass is designed for-->
        <p><b>This subclass is designed for the Sapirian settings.</b></p>

        <!--Subclass features. Add and remove number of features listed here as needed-->
        <h2><b>Bonus Proficiencies</b></h2>
        <p>You gain proficiency with lightning firearms and ignore the loading property for them.</p>

        <h2><b>Tactical Slide</b></h2>
        <p>You’ve learned how to slide around the battlefield to line up your shots better. As long as you have moved 10 feet and are not in difficult terrain, as a bonus action on your turn, you can slide up to 15 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. If you slide past an enemy, you gain advantage on your next attack against them and ignore the disadvantage from being within melee range of that enemy.</p>
        <p>The distance you can slide increases to 25ft at 9th level, and you can slide through difficult terrain at 15th level.</p>

        <h2><b>Fastest Hand in the West</b></h2>
        <p>Your hands move like lightning in response to danger. Starting at 7th level, you gain a bonus to your initiative equal to your proficiency bonus. Additionally, when you roll initiative and are not surprised, you can shoot a creature within range.</p>
        <p>If you trigger initiative by shooting a creature, that creature gains a negative penalty to initiative equal to your proficiency bonus unless it is immune to being surprised.</p>

        <h2><b>Hip Fire</b></h2>
        <p>You’ve learned how to trade accuracy for more volume. Starting at 10th level, you can take a negative penalty to all your attack rolls made to fire off more shots. For every shot you make beyond your maximum (up to your dexterity modifier), add a cumulative -1 penalty to every attack roll you make. Every shot you do hit gains a bonus to damage equal to the penalty from this feature. This can be done once per turn, and you must declare how many extra shots you will make before you attack.</p>
        <p>For example, firing 2 extra shots gives you a -2 penalty to all attack rolls, 3 shots is -3, etc.</p>

        <h2><b>Dangerous Play</b></h2>
        <p>You excel in dangerous situations and thrive like no one else. Starting at 15th level, whenever you start combat without any uses of Indomitable, you regain one use. Additionally, as a reaction when you take damage, you can expend one of your Indomitable uses to halve the damage.</p>

        <h2><b>Ultimate Gunslinger</b></h2>
        <p>Your skill with guns has become almost unparalleled. Starting at 18th level, you gain the following features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>You gain a +2 to all attack rolls made with lightning firearms.</p></li>
            <li><p>Every shot you hit with Hip Fire does extra damage equal to double the penalty from the feature.</p></li>
            <li><p>You can take an action immediately whenever you roll initiative, instead of just shooting once.</p></li>
        </ul>
