        <h1><b>Bard: College of Stories</b></h1>

        <!--Class flavor text-->
        <p><i>Though similar unlike Lore Bards, Story Bards focus on the story aspects and collecting them to share with the world. Stories of heroes and villains are meant to be shared, to inspire the masses.</i></p>
        <p><i>You excel at telling these in masterful ways, for this is your art and the world their canvas. There are countless stories, myths, legends, and epics out there, and you’re here to collect and tell them all. You may tell your stories through oral methods, such as plays or around the campfire, or through song. Think about how you tell stories, and who will tell of your epic journey when it’s all done.</i></p>
        <p><i>Consider also taking proficiency and expertise in performance if you plan on going this route.</i></p>

        <!--Campaign setting this subclass is designed for-->
        <p><b>This subclass is designed for all settings.</b></p>

        <!--Subclass features. Add and remove number of features listed here as needed-->
        <h2><b>Illusion Mastery.</b></h2>
        <p>When you pick this subclass, you gain the minor illusion cantrip, making it easier to tell your stories with visual elements. It doesn’t count against your cantrips known, and if you already have this cantrip, you may choose another. While telling a story, you can cast this spell and may include every effect, such as sound, image, and smell, all at once. If you include an image, it can be as large as a 10ft cube.</p>

        <h2><b>Stories Around the Campfire.</b></h2>
        <p>Additionally, at the 3rd level, you excel at inspiring others with your heroic stories during rests. Once per day, when you use your Song of Rest feature during a short rest, you may expend one Bardic Inspiration to give Bardic Inspiration to a number of creatures equal to your Charisma Modifier (minimum 1).</p>
        <p><i>Note: Inspiration lasts for one hour instead of 10 minutes as per the 2024 rules.</i></p>

        <h2><b>Heroes Rise, Villains Fall.</b></h2>
        <p>The stories you tell of heroes saving the day and defeating the villains bolster your allies and demoralize your enemies now as well. Starting at 6th level, a creature with your Bardic Inspiration may use their reaction to expend it and subtract the roll from an enemy creature’s d20 test as long as they are within 30 feet.</p>
        <p>Additionally, when a creature uses your Bardic Inspiration and still fails the d20 test, you regain that use. You may use your reaction to reapply it to the same creature, the standard Bardic Inspiration rules applying. You cannot go above your maximum amount of Inspiration.</p>

        <h2><b>Mastery Story Teller.</b></h2>
        <p>Additionally, starting at 6th level, when you make a Charisma (Performance) check, you treat all rolls 9 or lower as a 10.</p>

        <h2><b>Hero’s Determination</b></h2>
        <p>Your stories inspire your allies to persevere, even when the going gets tough. Starting at 14th level, when an allied creature within 60 feet that can hear you reaches 0 hitpoints, you may use your reaction and expend a Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Charisma (Performance) check, granting your ally as many hitpoints as was rolled on the check and the ability to move up to their speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>
        <p>A creature can only benefit from Hero’s Determination once per day.</p>
