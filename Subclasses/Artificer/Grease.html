        <!--Class flavor text-->
        <p><i>The Grease Monkey, another word for mechanic, these Artificers specialize in all things cars, whether it’s driving them, fixing them, shooting out of them, or sabotaging them. Grease Monkeys aren’t all about cars though, as some have been known to tinker more with guns and other strange electronic devices of their own invention.</i></p>

        <h2>Grease Monkey Magic</h2>
        <p>Starting at 3rd level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Grease Monkey Spells table. The spells count as Artificer spells for you, but don’t count against the number of Artificer spells you know.</p>

        <!--Subclass features. Add and remove number of features listed here as needed-->
        <p>*note that Artificers gain firearm proficiency as a base class feature</p>
        <h2><b>Vehicle Proficiency</b></h2>
        <p>When you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with Land Vehicles. If you already have this proficiency, you gain expertise in Land Vehicles. You also gain proficiency with Mechanics Tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain expertise in Mechanics Tools.</p>

        <h2><b>Jury Rig</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at level 3, whenever you are in or adjacent to vehicle, you can use an action to jury rig the vehicle, giving it one of the following benefits provided you have Mechanics Tools on hand:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Engine Efficiency: </b>The target vehicle has its move speed doubled until the end of the driver’s next turn.</li>
            <li><b>Quick Patch: </b>Make a Mechanics Tools check. The target vehicle gains hitpoints equal to the total of the check. Hitpoints that go over the vehicle’s maximum are converted into temporary hitpoints for the next minute.</li>
            <li><b>Sabotage: </b>Whenever a creature attempts to start the target vehicle it fails on the first attempt. On the second attempt, roll a d100. On a 51 or greater, the car starts. The car will start on the third attempt.</li>
            <li><b>Damage: </b>Make a Mechanics Tools check. The target vehicle takes damage equal to the total of the check, regardless if it reaches its Damage Threshold or not. Vehicles reduced to 0 hp are disabled until fixed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A vehicle can benefit from one jury rig per hour. You can perform a number of jury rigs equal to your Intelligence modifier per day.</p>

        <h2><b>Drive By Shooter</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at level 5, when you take the attack action, you can attack twice on your turn, instead of once. If you are driving a vehicle, you can make one attack with a one-handed weapon while still maintaining control of the vehicle.</p>

        <h2><b>Level 9 Feature</b></h2>
        <p>The Upside is designed for lower level play. Thus, high level features have not been invented yet for this subclass.</p>

        <h2><b>Level 15 Feature</b></h2>
        <p>The Upside is designed for lower level play. Thus, high level features have not been invented yet for this subclass.</p>
