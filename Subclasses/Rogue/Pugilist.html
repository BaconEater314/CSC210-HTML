        <h1><b>Rogue: Pugilist</b></h1>

        <!--Class flavor text-->
        <p><i>For rogues who like to get up close and personal, specifically with their fists. Not afraid to throw hands, literally, these rogues are in the thick of the fight, throwing it down in hand-to-hand combat. With tricks up their sleeves, these rogues will also play dirty to get the upper hand in battle.</i></p>

        <!--Campaign setting this subclass is designed for-->
        <p><b>This subclass is designed for all settings.</b></p>

        <!--Subclass features. Add and remove number of features listed here as needed-->
        <h2><b>Brawler</b></h2>
        <p>When you choose this archetype at level 3, your unarmed strikes use your Dexterity to attack and deal damage. Your fists deal 1d6 + your Dexterity modifier in Bludgeoning damage. If you have the Tavern Brawler feat, it increases to a d8. Your fists can also proc Sneak Attack.</p>

        <h2><b>Dirty Fighting</b></h2>
        <p>Additionally, when you choose this Archetype, you learn several moves to put your enemies at a disadvantage. As a bonus action, you can make an unarmed strike and choose one of the following effects if you hit.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Pocket Sand:</b> Target must make a Constitution Saving Throw or be Blinded until the end of their next turn, or until a creature uses an action to wipe it off.</li>
            <li><b>Sweep the Legs:</b> Target must make a Strength Saving Throw or be knocked Prone.</li>
            <li><b>Sucker Punch:</b> Target must make a Constitution Saving Throw or have disadvantage on all Attack Rolls made until the end of its next turn.</li>
            <li><b>Slam:</b> You try to slam the target’s head into a nearby wall, table, or other applicable object. The target must make a Strength Saving Throw. Roll half your Sneak Attack dice (rounded down). The target takes that much damage on a fail, or half as much on a success. There must be an object or piece of terrain within reach to do this.</li>
            <li><b>Box the Ears:</b> Target must make a Constitution Saving Throw or lose their reactions until the start of your next turn.</li>
            <li><b>Throat Punch:</b> Target must make a Constitution Saving Throw or be silenced until the end of their next turn.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Save DC for these effects is 8 + your proficiency bonus + Dexterity modifier.</p>
        <p>You can make these attacks a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier per rest.</p>

        <h2><b>Uncanny Attack</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at level 9, you can strike after dodging blows. Whenever you use your Uncanny Dodge feature, you can make an Unarmed Strike against a creature within range. On a hit, you can use one of your Dirty Fighting moves, provided you still have uses left.</p>

        <h2><b>One Two</b></h2>
        <p>Beginning at level 13, you’ve learned how to take advantage of dealing heavy blows. Whenever you score a critical hit with an Unarmed Strike or roll above average on your Sneak Attack damage dice, you can follow up with a second blow for free, which deals half your Sneak Attack dice (rounded up) on a hit.</p>
        <p>The average damage for Sneak Attack dice is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>7d6 = 24.5</li>
            <li>8d6 = 28</li>
            <li>9d6 = 31.5</li>
            <li>10d6 = 35</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><b>Ultimate Boxer</b></h2>
        <p>Beginning at level 17, your unarmed prowess knows no bounds. Whenever you successfully land an Unarmed Strike, you deal +1 damage on your next blow, and so on until you miss, at which point you lose half of the bonus damage (rounded down). If you land a critical blow, the damage increases by +2.</p>
        <p>This effect resets when you end combat.</p>
