        <h1><b>Rogue: Commando</b></h1>

        <!--Class flavor text-->
        <p><i>The Commando is a Rogue that specializes in firearms, but few are the same. Some are quick on the draw, some are stealth shooters in the bushes or silent as the grave, and some get up close and personal. Regardless of your style, danger is your middle name.</i></p>

        <!--Campaign setting this subclass is designed for-->
        <p><b>This subclass is designed for the Sapirian settings.</b></p>

        <!--Subclass features. Add and remove number of features listed here as needed-->
        <h2><b>Bonus Proficiencies</b></h2>
        <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with lightning firearms.</p>

        <h2><b>Gunning Style</b></h2>
        <p>Your style is unique to you, and you choose how you fight with your guns. Starting at 3rd level, you may choose one of the following gunning styles listed below. Whenever you gain an ability score improvement, you can choose to swap out one of these options.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><b>Bush Sniper:</b> You gain the benefits of the Sharpshooter feat. Additionally, sneak attacks made at long range or past 30ft with the Lightning Sharpshooter treat all 1s as 2s.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Static Sneak Attack:</b> When you land a sneak attack with a statically pumped pump-action rifle, the bonus damage multiplies your sneak attack as well.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Silencer:</b> Attacks made with lightning guns are silenced, meaning enemies cannot immediately pinpoint you via noise when you stealthily hit them.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Tactical Dive:</b> When you use the Burst Fire option with a revolver, you can dive up to 15 feet away without landing prone. Additionally, you don’t have disadvantage on one attack roll made higher than your maximum.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Quickdraw:</b> As long as you are not surprised, as a reaction to initiative being rolled, you may attack a creature, adding your sneak attack damage on a hit. This cannot work with two-handed guns.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Pointblank Shot:</b> Ranged attacks you make within melee range of an enemy no longer have disadvantage. Additionally, shots against targets within 5 feet of you with the Shotblaster can push a large or smaller creature back on a failed strength save (DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + dex modifier). Creatures that fail are pushed back 10 feet.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2><b>Extra Attack</b></h2>
        <p>Starting at 9th level, you now ignore the loading property for lightning firearms, and you can make an additional attack on your turn when you take the attack action.</p>

        <h2><b>Gunning Style Upgrade</b></h2>
        <p>Your skill with guns and your style have improved immensely. Starting at 13th level, you may choose to either upgrade your gunning style (detailed below) or choose two additional options from the level 3 feature.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><b>Bush Sniper:</b> Your critical hit range increases to 19-20, and all damage at long range or past 30ft with the sharpshooter treat all 1s and 2s as 3s.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Static Sneak Attack:</b> When you use your cunning action or your uncanny dodge, you can also pump your rifle.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Silencer:</b> Your silenced guns automatically crit on an attack against an enemy that is not actively searching for you.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Tactical Dive:</b> You no longer have disadvantage on any of the attacks made with the Burst Fire feature.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Quickdraw:</b> You gain a bonus to your initiative equal to your proficiency bonus, and if you go first in combat, you can make an additional attack on your turn.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Pointblank Shot:</b> Ranged attacks against creatures within 5 feet are now made with advantage. If this is done with a Shotblaster, it does maximum damage (16+dex) and can push up to huge creatures back 15 feet.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2><b>Deadeye</b></h2>
        <p>Your skill has reached an incredible level, so much that you’ve gained the ability to capitalize on powerful shots and killing blows. Starting at 17th level, your critical hit range increases by 1. Additionally, when you kill a creature or land a critical hit, you can make another attack, dealing your sneak attack damage even if you have already used it that turn. Subsequent shots only apply half your sneak attack dice on a hit.</p>
        <p>You may chain a number of attacks equal to your dexterity modifier. None of these extra attacks count against your second attack if this happens on your first.</p>
