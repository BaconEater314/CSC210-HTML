        <h1><p>Ardoni</p></h1>
        <p><i>The Ardoni are a race of innately magical humanoids that journeyed from Mazteca. The Ardoni are formidable warriors and mages due to their innate magical abilities, unique to them. Upon death, they are buried in special graveyards with stone markings matching theirs so they may forever shine on.</i></p>
        <p><i>Each Ardoni possesses a unique pattern of markings all over their slate grey bodies that are inherited from one of their parents and glows with the color of their clan. Their eyes also glow softly the same color as their patterns, as well as the edges of their pointy ears, which grow longer as they age. When they die, their glow goes out, and as they age, they dim. Aging at the same rate as humans, they reach maturity at 18 and live up to 800 years, though few make it that far. The Ardoni are divided into 5 clans, not including the clanless: The Voltaris (Red), The Sendaris (Blue), The Nestoris (Yellow), The Kaltaris (Green), and the Mendoris (Purple). All Ardoni have the last name of their clan.</i></p>

            <p><b>Creature Type:</b> You are Humanoid</p>
            <p><b>Size:</b> You are medium or small. You choose the size when you select this race. Ardoni range in height in build, but typical Ardoni range from 5’ 6” upwards to 7’.</p>
            <p><b>Speed:</b> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>

            <p><b>Songs of War:</b> The Ardoni have the unique ability to use “Songs”, magical abilities bonded to the user until death. At special shrines, an Ardoni may bond with one of each type over the course of an hour. Each Ardoni may also only wield one song of each category. Songs come in cube forms that are dropped upon death to be bonded by another Ardoni or sold to the right buyer for a decent amount of money.</p>
            <p> The Songs come in 4 variants: Supporium (Green), Protisium (Blue), Mobilium (Yellow), and Aggressium (Red). Of each type, there is a variant called a Prime Song, which allows the user to use every song of that type. These are deemed too powerful for one person to wield and are kept safe with the eldest of elders of each clan (called a Master).</p>

            <p><b>Darkvision:</b> You have Darkvision out to 60 feet.</p>
            <p><b>Languages:</b> You can speak, read, and write Common and Ardoni. Ardoni is a strange musical language that is often pleasant to the ears.</p>
