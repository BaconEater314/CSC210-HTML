        <h1>Glyphids</h1>
        <p>Deep below the surface, ancient Duergar caverns sprawl for miles, teeming with subterranean life, precious minerals and providing access to the Underdark. Construction and excavation on the surface in the last 40 years has disturbed the caverns beneath, which has driven some of the wildlife upwards, though none have been more affected than the <b>Glyphids</b>. Giant armored arachnids, Glyphids are predatory, eusocial, and highly territorial. Nymphal glyphids, colloquially referred to as <b>swarmers</b> have become somewhat common pests in basements and sewers, though mature glyphids are thankfully rare to find outside of their endemic caverns.</p>
        <p>Glyphids are prized for their thick chitin, which can be worked into sturdy plates that are as hard as softer metals like bronze, without being conductive. Worker glyphids, or <b>Grunts</b>, are generally safe enough to farm, though domesticated glyphids are still rather feisty. The larger and more dangerous of the glyphid castes have to be hunted. The <b>Deeprock Corporation</b> employs crews to hunt and recover some of the most dangerous types.</p>
