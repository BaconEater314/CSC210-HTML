        <h1>The Corporations</h1>
        <p>Globe-spanning titans of industry, to most, the corporations represent the same things the Five Families do, criminality and greed, only with the exception that they are legally allowed to operate. The CEOs, often called <b>The Robber Barons</b> by the people, are some of the most powerful people on the planet, more powerful than even the governments of some nations.</p>
        
        <h3>Deeprock Corporation</h3>
        <p>What was once a small time Dwarven Mining operation has ballooned into a titan of the mining industry. They are the textbook example of “horizontal integration,” controlling all of the mining operations of the Sapirian continent, and are voyaging eastward to the Sword Coast to expand their influence. They also have been getting involved in glyphid hunting as of more recently. They are the only company to have a strong labor union, and as a result of such, are constantly embroiled in negligence and workman’s compensation lawsuits.</p>
        <p><b>CEO:</b> Kivish Bronzehatchet</p>
        <p><b>Headquarters:</b> Duria, Duraria, Sapiria</p>

        <h3>Standard Electric</h3>
        <p>Standard Electric has sunk their teeth deep into the city’s power grid. Their lobbying of the government has made electricity totally privatized. With total control of the power grid, they have been able to hike the price of electricity, leaving thousands in the dark. The CEO is also suspected of being a vampire.</p>
        <p><b>CEO:</b> Alaric Voss</p>
        <p><b>Headquarters:</b> Swifthallow, Draconia, Sapiria</p>

        <h3>Sword Coast Trader’s Bank</h3>
        <p>One of the largest and oldest of the corporations, Sword Coast Trader’s Bank had a rocky start back in the 1480s. Initially, their service was straightforward, one could deposit their hard earned coin, and withdraw it later at one of their branches in Baldur’s Gate or Waterdeep, or at the central location in Daggerford. It was their Lending division that caused trouble, though, as the people of Daggerford were skeptical of the company, preferring to work with their local acquaintances, but they decided to take a gamble and expand their lending to their branches. Their gamble paid off, and Sword Coast Trader’s Bank has ballooned into a massive operation that's just too big to fail.</p>
        <p><b>CEO:</b> Lord Dulbravvan Anteos V</p>
        <p><b>Headquarters:</b> Daggerford, Delimbiyr Vale, Sword Coast, Faerûn</p>

        <h3>Asahara Holdings, Inc.</h3>
        <p>What started in 1650 as a young man traveling door to door selling linens after being inspired by a story about a beggar who became a millionaire by trading a piece of straw has exploded into a global finance titan. Asahara is a completely different beast compared to Faerûnian corporations, the Zaibatsu model. Zaibatsu corporations like Asahara hold significant influence over the Waan economy, though Asahara is as of yet the only one of these industrial titans to breach the international market.. Its nickname in its home country is the “Yamata-no-Orochi,” or “The 8 Headed Serpent,” a title it picked up from its 8 divisions which almost act as companies of their own; Foods, Textiles, Machinery, Metals & Minerals, Energy & Chemicals, Communications, Realty, and “The 8th Company” which mediates the frequent internal disputes between the 8 divisions. </p>
        <p><b>CEO:</b> Masayoshi Asahara</p>
        <p><b>Headquarters:</b> Uwaji, Tsukishima, Wa, Kara-Tur</p>

        <h3>Vargr</h3>
        <p>A “security” company only in the loosest sense, Vargr is an Icewind Dale based company that works in the business of soldiers of fortune. Hired by governments and corporations alike, Vargr forces are known to be some of the best of the best. Founded by the son of the Jarl of Caer-Konig, Vargr has deep ties to the Zhentarim, and is suspected of having involvement in rebellions, revolutions, and civil wars across Faerûn and Zakhara, as well as busting Deeprock Miner’s Union strikes.</p>
        <p><b>CEO:</b> Johan Gustávsonn</p>
        <p><b>Headquarters:</b> Caer-Konig, Icewind Dale, Faerûn</p>

        <h3>Winston Arms</h3>
        <p>The newest and smallest of the companies, Winston Arms is a growing weapons manufacturer, what they lack in hard corporate power, they more than make up for with their lucrative arms deals, allowing Winston Arms to secure contracts with much bigger fish than themselves.</p>
        <p><b>CEO:</b> Winston White</p>
        <p><b>Headquarters:</b> Duria, Duraria, Sapiria</p>

        <h2>Glyphids</h2>
        <p>Deep below the surface, ancient Duergar caverns sprawl for miles, teeming with subterranean life, precious minerals and providing access to the Underdark. Construction and excavation on the surface in the last 40 years has disturbed the caverns beneath, which has driven some of the wildlife upwards, though none have been more affected than the <b>Glyphids</b>. Giant armored arachnids, Glyphids are predatory, eusocial, and highly territorial. Nymphal glyphids, colloquially referred to as <b>swarmers</b> have become somewhat common pests in basements and sewers, though mature glyphids are thankfully rare to find outside of their endemic caverns.</p>
        <p>Glyphids are prized for their thick chitin, which can be worked into sturdy plates that are as hard as softer metals like bronze, without being conductive. Worker glyphids, or <b>Grunts</b>, are generally safe enough to farm, though domesticated glyphids are still rather feisty. The larger and more dangerous of the glyphid castes have to be hunted. The <b>Deeprock Corporation</b> employs crews to hunt and recover some of the most dangerous types.</p>
