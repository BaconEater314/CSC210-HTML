        <h1>Global History Crash Course</h1>
        <p>If you’re used to the forgotten realms, you may notice things have changed a bit in the last 400 years, and if you’re no stranger to the Sapiran setting, you probably haven't seen much of what’s going on in the rest of the world. 400 years of global history could fill several documents on its own, so this section will be a “highlight reel” of some of the most significant happenings.</p>
        <p>By <b>1520 DR,</b> Waterdhavian, Chondathi, Calishite, Thayvian and Cormyrian colonies were established across Osse and Katashaka. These colonies (bar the Thavyian) are still held today, (though border conflicts between colonial powers has led to the repeated drawing and redrawing of borders and holdings) extracting resources and labor from the indigenous populations.</p>
        <p>In <b>1855 DR,</b> the <b>Second Zulkir War</b> would break out as the council of the Zulkir enacted a long-awaited scheme to overthrow High Regent Szass Tam and claim power for themselves. Tam, having long suspected treachery, ordered the several undead Zulkir to betray their living counterparts, though the Zulkir of Divination, <b>Desz Kadorn</b>, was able to foresee the betrayal. The Living and Dead Zulkir mustered whatever forces they could, and what ensued was a 10 year long civil war, and one of the bloodiest conflicts in Thayvian history. When the war ended in 1865, all of the living Zulkir were killed, as well as <b>Valindra Shadowmantle,</b> the loyalist Zulkir of Necromancy, <b>Samas Kul,</b> the loyalist Zulkir of Transmutation, and Tam himself, along with his phylactery. Within 3 years of the end of the civil war, the Thayvian empire had all but collapsed. Colonial holdings revolted, peasants and slaves overthrew their masters. Thay fell into turmoil as external powers attempted to turn Thay into a puppet state and internal unrest made a reestablishment of the government difficult. The Thayvian Government was ultimately reestablished, with the remaining undead Zulkir being ousted and replaced with new, living Zulkir. Despite this, however, the government and economy remain in shambles.</p>
