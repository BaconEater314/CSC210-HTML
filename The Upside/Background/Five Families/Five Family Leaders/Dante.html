        <h2>Dante De Luca</h2>
        <p>The physically oldest of the leaders of the Five Families, at 97 years old, Dante De Luca is a curmudgeonly old schemer, meticulous in all things, creating contingencies for his contingencies. Though his body is failing, his mind is as sharp as ever. He hates technology and refuses to use it personally, though he sees no issue delegating its use to the more savvy of his Capos. He delegates most field work to his Consigliere and grandson, Bruno.</p>
