        <h2>Sakazuki Kojiro</h2>
        <p>Born to a noble samurai family of Wa, the Sakazuki clan, along with many others, were forced to flee after the abolition of the samurai caste and the ousting of the emperor in 1868 DR. While most found their way west, into Faerûn, many sailed east, around the globe and finding their way to Sapiria. The Sakazuki clan was one of those. Kojiro is the original founder of the organization and maintains the Samurai traditions as the oyabun of  his criminal organization.</p>
