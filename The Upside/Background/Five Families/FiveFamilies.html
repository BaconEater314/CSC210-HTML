        <h1>The Five Families</h1>
        <p>The Five Families are the five most powerful criminal syndicates in the city. Comprised of the <b>Five Dragons Triad, Yaguára Cartel, Cappodocian Family, Sakazuki-Gumi, and The Northside Mob.</b> The families bicker and feud with each other often and alliances are tenuous. Each family is primarily involved in a major crime; The Five Dragons deal in Human Trafficking, The Yaguára Cartel are the premier manufacturer of narcotics, the Cappadocians control gambling operations, the Sakazuki-Gumi are extortionists and loan sharks, and the Northside Mob controls Bootlegging operations.</p>

        <h3>The Five Dragons Triad</h3>
        <p>The Five Dragons Triad are said to have descended from members of a long-defeated Dragon Cult from two hundred years ago. They operate a huge human trafficking ring, smuggling people in and out of the city; Many are never seen again. Some say that those trafficked are being sacrificed to an ancient dragon god. Members are primarily human, though take Draconic names.</p>

        <h3>Yaguára Cartel</h3>
        <p>Founded by remnants of the Interdimensional invasion of the Maztican army who refused to assimilate, they operate with militaristic efficiency, ruling over the city’s drug game. They are one of the smaller families, as they mostly consist of the original Maztican races: Orcs, Half-Orcs, Ardoni, and Tabaxi, and are particular about who they let into their family, but are highly efficient with their work.</p>

        <h3>Cappodocian Family</h3>
        <p>The oldest of the Five Families, The Cappadocian Family was founded in 1630 DR by Giovanni Cappadocian. The Cappadocian operate a byzantine operation with fingers in every pie at the governmental level, granting them near immunity for their operations. They control a city-wide ring of casinos, horse betting, and underground fight clubs, where they sucker the desperate out of their money with fixed games. Under the boss and his Consigliere are 16 Caporegimes who each operate a team of 12-16 made men, as well as hundreds of associates affiliated with the family despite not being made men.</p>

        <h3>Sakazuki-Gumi</h3>
        <p>Founded by immigrants from Wa and Kozakura, Members of the Sakazuki-Gumi ink themselves with elaborate tattoos on their backs to identify their membership. Members follow a strict honor code, and those who shame the family are punished by having fingers cut off, while those accused of more serious offenses will commit ritual suicide. They offer high interest loans to those who can't get one from the banks, with brutal consequences for those who fail to pay on time.</p>

        <h3>The Northside Mob</h3>
        <p>The largest of the Five Families, The Northside Mob is a loose coalition of various local operations, from family bootlegging businesses to small-medium sized gangs of their own, though they are all unified under the Northside Banner by threat of retaliation by Paddy O'Neil; Some merely pay lip service, while others are fiercely loyal. They are hard to pin down and reproduce like a hydra. Every operation destroyed spawns two more. Most operations run just outside city limits, brewing and smuggling bootleg alcohol into the city.</p>
