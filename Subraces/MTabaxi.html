        <h1><p>Tabaxi: Maztecan Tabaxi</p></h1>
        <p><i>The Maztecan Tabaxi are the same as detailed in the Monsters of the Multiverse, with two additional features due to extensive military training in the Maztecan army.</i></p>
        <p><b>This subrace is only available after 17010 DR</b></p>

        <div>
            <p><b>Military Training:</b> You gain proficiency with martial weapons, light armor, and shields. If you already have proficiency in light armor, you gain medium armor proficiency, and if you have medium you gain heavy armor proficiency. If you already have proficiency with martial weapons, you gain one weapon mastery feature, which can be swapped out for another every long rest.</p>
            <p><b>Deserter (Rise of an Empire Only):</b> You have left the New Maztecan Army to go your own path, your reasons your own. You can fit in with the Maztecan army easily if need be, but if you are recognized as a deserter, there will be consequences. You also have extensive knowledge of the chain of command.</p>
            <p><b>Languages:</b> Instead of standard Tabaxi, you speak a dialect called Maztecan Tabaxi, which is similar but different enough to tell the difference. Although you can communicate with those who speak standard Tabaxi, it is difficult.</p>
