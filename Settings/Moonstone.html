        <!-- A comprehensive section to cover the events proceeding the Moonstone Eclipse for context. -->
        <h2>Saprian War</h2>
        <p>200 years after the Giant War, the ambitious King Velgrin III decided that the continent should be united into one nation of Kanari. He declared war on Duraria and invaded, marching his armies through Tarwin’s Gap in the Numerian Mountains and taking Fort Dawnguard. They quickly pushed to Duria, but the siege was foiled by an ancient defense mechanism the dwarves built hundreds of years ago. The two nations were locked into a bloody stalemate, with Kanari holding the north-eastern side of Duraria.</p>
        <p>One day, a young man signed up for the Durian spy corps. This boy strangely had the innate ability to turn invisible inside the shadows and teleport to other darker spaces. With the help of the new spy, dubbed the Shadowbreaker by the Kanari, along with the high intelligence of King Jervasko Blackwood’s archmage, Davolm Moonstone, they turned around the war, pushing back the Kanari. The Shadowbreaker performed a pivotal role in the battle of Newham, which ended in a disastrous defeat for Kanari. Once Fort Dawnguard was retaken, the Durarians set their eyes on Fort Rindermont to punish Kanari for their transgressions.</p>
        <p>Severin Waterstriker, looking to gain more experience as a fighter, joined the war effort. Though he was the second child of Sanghelios and Trisora Waterstriker, he was given Arkazar to take care of since his older brother Wulfgar, was deemed too violent. Severin was assigned to the defense of Fort Rindermont under the command of Colonel Jethryn Fauntere. Assigned to Jethryn’s daughter’s squad, Severin served with Lieutenant Caitlyn Fauntere. During one of the assaults on Fort Rindermont, Caitlyn was killed by a fireball from Moonstone but revived by Severin using a scroll of Revivify Caitlyn had received from her father when she was promoted.</p>
        <p>Worried for her safety, Jethryn sent Caitlyn away under escort by Severin. As they were walking down the path, they stopped to argue. Maron Shadowbreaker, who was spying on them, accidentally stepped on a twig while backing away, causing them to stop. Though he covered his tracks well, Severin was able to track Maron to a secret pass through the mountains.</p>
        <p>After the war was over, Serverin and Caitlyn fell in love. Maron did not get a happy ending. Some high-ranking general, deeming he knew too many military (and non-military) secrets, ordered the execution of the Shadowbreaker. After killing the general, Maron held King Jervasko hostage until he was pardoned for his crimes, after which he still disappeared.</p>
        
        <h2>Moonstone Rising</h2>
        <p>6 months after the war, Davolm Moonstone and several of his comrades ventured into the Realm of Darkness seeking a large group of Grimm that had curiously captured humanoids. When they caught up with them, the humanoids were tossed into the black tar pits and transformed into a new kind of Grimm. Despite a protective spell masking their emotions, they were discovered. When Moonstone was blown off his feet, he landed partway into the pool. He barely survived, and he found himself partly transformed, and his allies dead. He was ignored by the Grimm that patrolled the lands as he made his way home.</p>
        <p>Disguising himself, he returned to his home city of Esterford, having failed. He continued teaching his goddaughter, Amaranthe Larona, in the ways of wizardry. But the darkness slowly corrupted his mind, and he became more violent. Six months later, he finally snapped. The city of Esterford burned as he slaughtered his way to the Larona Manor. </p>
        <p>After killing the family, he faced Amara and revealed his true form to her in the burning building she once called home. The skin on the left side of his body was black and leathery, his hand a claw with sharp bone blades for fingernails, the eye unblinking, glowing orange flame. Slashing her through the eyes, he blinded her, but she pushed him out of the building with magic. When he came to his feet, the building collapsed on itself. Smiling wickedly and satisfied with the carnage, he began the trek towards the capital.</p>
        <p>Borris Kaltar, a cleric of Pelor who went with Moonstone to the Realm of Darkness, returned to life after his god brought him back to life as a reward for his faithful service, appeared in Esterford as the Larona Manor collapsed. He ran to the scene just after Moonstone left to find a blinded Amara crawling away from the burning wreckage.</p>
        <p>But instead of heading to the capital, Moonstone decided to take a chance and recruit the betrayed Maron Shadowbreaker, figuring he might want revenge for what was done to him.</p>
        <p>Severin was heading home to Swifthallow with news of his new proposal and was passing through Rivermere, where Maron happened to be at the time. Having just killed some bandits and taken a courier’s letter for Maron from King Jervasko per the courier’s dying wish, he arrived in the town and ran into Maron. After giving him the letter, he left but returned after seeing smoke rising from the village.</p>
        <p>Moonstone, angry Maron refused to help him, attacked civilians, and burned some buildings in his rage. After help from a local wild magic sorcerer, Nicole Califarn, Maron managed to score a hit on Moonstone, who then retreated. They agreed to travel together to help take the evil wizard down.</p>
        <p>On the way to Duraria, they ran into the rogue Christopher Blackwood and his pixie druid friend named Maria Riverblossom. They agreed to help since Jervasko was Chris’s brother. In the city of Duria, they met with the King, who enlisted the help of his bounty hunter, a ranger named William Braxton. Together, they fought Moonstone in an old wizard’s laboratory up in the Dragon’s Teeth.</p>
        <p>During the fight, in a desperate attempt to defeat Moonstone, Nicole collapsed the cavern and sacrificed her life to save her friends. Moonstone was no more, or so they thought…</p>
