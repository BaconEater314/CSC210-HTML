        <h2>Waterdeep: Dragon Heist and More</h2>
        <h3>Dragon Heist</h3>
        <p>200 years ago, four intrepid adventurers looked to amass a fortune in the city of Waterdeep by looting the famed Vault of Dragons.</p>
        <p>The party consisted of:</p>
        <p>Jeff, a Chaotic Capitilist Tiefling Bard,</p>
        <p>Brieze, an Ex-Pirate Captain Tiefling Warlock,</p>
        <p>Laska, a Goliath Sorcerer who was never without his walking stick,</p>
        <p>and Sierra, a Dragonborn Fighter with dwarfism and bad eyesight</p>

        <p>Despite their, interesting backgrounds, our "heroes" banded together under a strange circumstance to rescue a friend of Volothamp Geddarn,
            earning them a home in Waterdeep, a Tavern of their own.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conveniently, an nearby fireball attack by two warring factions set off their chase for the Vault of Dragons. The ran around the city, chased secrets, 
            and found clues, eventually paving their way to claim the Vault for themselves, with a large portion going to the city per a deal they made with the Open Lord.
        </p>
        <h3>Phandelin</h3>
        <p>After claiming the vault, the adventurers were given an opportunity to restore an ancient mine in Phandelin. Intrigued, they set off and uncovered the secrets
            of the region. However, the most important event that occured, was the creation of the god Joe. First a joke, it somehow grew into a small religion, Laska at the head.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Church of Joe spread quickly and had a high popularity amongst the monstrous races who freed themselves from their oppressive rulers. 
            This religion is most popular among goblins, bugbears, hobgoblins, and kobolds as they tend to have oppressive leadership.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of this adventure, they acquired a black dragon egg from a passing adventurer. It was born in Waterdeep and was named Ebony.</p>

        <h3>War of the Sword Coast</h3>
        <p>
            Three years later, after many years of investing and designing, the party had become rich. Jeff invented the first airship, and pioneered lightning catching.
            When the Blackstaff was killed by Zhentarim assassins in their Tavern after a long battle, the legendary staff stolen by Manshoon, the city became under threat
            by Lord Neverember from Neverwinter who looked to expand his influence across the sword coast. Allying with an Ancient Dragon, Ebony's Mother Vysilas,
            they city of Waterdeep was besieged. In order to defeat Vyrsilas, she was let in through the magical protections and ambushed by the party and the gold
            dragon Aurinax who guarded the Vault of Dragons.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fearing death, the Open Lord charged the adventurers with helping defend the city, and to help her escape when the city finally fell. Though their attempts
            were valliant, the city finally fell after Zhentarim agents helped the Neverwinter forces infiltrate the city. The fled to Icewindale to hide and gather allies.
        </p>
        <h3>Icewind Dale and the return to Waterdeep</h3>
        <p>
            The adventurers stumbled on a plot by the Duergar to destroy the Ten Towns and take control of the region after a sentient Snake Wizard named Jiggy requested
            their help after her party were defeated by the Duergar. They defeated the Duergar and then the minor goddess Auril the Frostmaiden, before invading the
            forgotten city of Ythryn. After making a deal with Avarice, she helped them breach the wizard tower in the center in exchange for a magical artifact.

            Unbeknownst to them, the artifact was a scroll of Summon Tarrasque, which would later be used against them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The party returned to Waterdeep, and with the help of their allies and a rebel cell in the city, they retook control, assassinating Neverember and throwing
            the armies into chaos using the last remaining Walking Statue, awakened after an old friend of theirs defeated Manshoon and claimed the Blackstaff.

            When the dust settled, and Waterdeep was retaken, Avarice returned. Her patron, Levistus, made a deal with Bane the god of tyranny, whom Joe had declared
            his enemy. Avarice, using the scroll, summoned a Tarrasque to destroy the city. Our heroes sprung into action, and upon their dragon friends, Ebony, Aurinax
            and Zelifarn, they fought valiantly to protect the city, to prevent it from being destroyed. Avarice and the Tarrasque was defeated, her plot foiled.
        </p>

        <h3>The Ancient Lich</h3>
        <p>
            10 years later, during the celebration of the 10th Anniversary of the defeat of the Tarrasque, a new threat emerged. An ancient Lich had returned to torment
            the Sword Coast, and claim a prize he sought for centuries: the Staff of Waterdeep. This immensely powerful staff had been previously reforged by our heroes
            and with the aid of the Open Lord. Assisted by an warrior named Arkazar Waterstriker, who had come from overseas seeking trade and airship technology, they
            returned to Phandelin to save it from the Lich's forces, and decended into his lair to defeat him once and for all.

            Sierra went back with Arkazar to Sapiria, where she partook in an event known as the Grimm Campaign that looked to push back the creatures of darkness from
            the southern region. Sierra also eventually married Arkazar.
