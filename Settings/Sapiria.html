        <h1>Sapiria</h1>
        <p>This page is dedicated to the Sapiria setting and its history.</p>

        <!-- A comprehensive section to cover the events proceeding the Moonstone Eclipse for context. -->
        <h2>Welcome to Sapiria</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Sapiria! This small continent consists of two large sections of landmass connected by a small portion of land filled with mountains. The northern half is the nation known as Kanari, and the southern half is Duraria. Besides humans, Kanari is mainly dragonborn, and Duraria is mainly elves and dwarves. There is a healthy mix of the other races.</p>
        <p>Sapiria’s earth has a strange property of unknown origin. The ground absorbs the blood spilled and forms a mineral called Blood Iron. This mineral is as strong as steel and easily enchanted. Some weapons and armor are known to possess unusual properties. There are two main mines in Sapiria where the biggest battles were fought, one outside of Newham and the other outside of Swifthallow.</p>
        <p>In the southwestern corner of Duraria, there is a strange land. Beyond the massive wall lies a desolate plain filled with cracks and ravines and all sorts of malignant creatures. No sentient creature would want to live there, not for its inhospitable nature (because you could live there) but for the unnatural dark land beyond it: The Realm of Darkness. This area is less livable than the frozen wastes, the hottest deserts, and the lowest depths. Everything here is deadly. </p>
        <p>Strange creatures that seem to be made of darkness, called the Grimm, prowl about these lands. They spawn from pools of thick black tar and can come in all shapes and sizes, all deadly. Their skin is black, coarse, and leathery, and white bone pieces form skulls, ribs, and armor on these creatures. Their glowing red eyes instill fear into those who see them. The Creatures of Grimm thrive off negative emotion and can sense anybody who feels fear, hatred, anger, etc. The wall is meant to keep these creatures from reaching civilized areas, but it’s not perfect. Occasionally, they do escape, though, and are rarely seen in Duraria, almost unheard of in Kanari.</p>

        <h2>The Giant War</h2>
        <p>Around the same time my siblings were exploiting capitalism for their gains, Sapiria was having its continent-wide event. Giants came down from the mountains near Swifthallow before the city was founded and raged war against the Kanari across the Radover River. At the time, the dragonborn were split into 5 tribes, and the Kanari kingdom had expanded as far east as the Radover on the southern side and as far as Langdale on the northern side. The tribes owned the land north of Avonmouth and as far west as Colchester.</p>
        <p>The tribes consisted of the Frostshapers (White and Silver) in the far northwest, the Firebreathers (Brass, Gold, and Red) in the volcanic region, the Sandstorms (Bronze and Blue) in the desert, the Jungle Dragons (Copper, Black, and Green) in the Sarbord Jungle, and the Gemhearts (gem dragonborn) in the center. Though there was some mixing with the Gemhearts having the most diversity, they mostly stayed separate. This was due to past events proving they couldn’t work together.</p>
        <p>When the Kanari finally forced back the giants with aid from the Durarians to the Radover, they locked into a bloody stalemate. The giants then turned their eyes to the north, where the dragonborn tribes lived. Slowly but surely, they pushed their way into the Gemheart's territory.</p>
        <p>Arkazar Waterstriker, the young Silver Chieftan of the Frostshapers, recognized the danger of the encroaching Giant army. The Gemhearts were the largest faction of the five, and if they were defeated, the other four stood no chance divided. He first tried to gain support from the Firebreathers and Jungle Dragons, who refused, believing they could hold and that an alliance wouldn’t work out. The Sandstorms were less hostile but also hesitant.</p>
        <p>Angry from a lack of support, Arkazar marched his army anyway to the aid of the Gemhearts. His arrival turned the tide at the battle at Gemheart's capital town, which is now known as Strotham. Arkazar and his brother Valthus led the charge. He hoped that this fight would convince the others to join him, but that war was not won just yet. His campaign against the Giants was successful, and the armies under his command came to the aid of the Sandstorms when the giants came for them next. They joined, forming the first Dragonborn Union in a long time.</p>
        <p>The tribes worked together, Arkazar expertly using each of their strength to his advantage on the battlefield, and slowly they pushed back the giants. Eventually, the Jungle Dragons and finally the Firebreathers were pressured into joining, creating an army to rival the giants.</p>
        <p>Arkazar met with King Velgin I the night before the final battle in West Riverwood, the eastern side taken and burned by the giants (these towns later became Westwood and Eastwood). They devised a battle plan together with the Durarians and executed it the following morning.</p>
        <p>The three armies met the giants at the hills of Swifthallow in a final bloody clash. Both threw everything they had at each other. Originally, Arkazar and Valthus fought side-by-side on the front lines but separated when Valthus went to aid the southern contingent at their request.</p>
        <p>Many hours later, blood-soaked Arkazar climbed a hill to overlook the battlefield. Upon that hill, he saw the giant king, Thulkaum, a massive fire giant, watching from a large outcropping. Valthus appeared out of nowhere with some elite warriors and dashed for the king, almost defeating him in combat before his soldiers were overwhelmed and he was struck from behind. Thulkaum ran him through, killing him.</p>
        <p>Overcome with grief and anger, Arkazar called for a massive charge, intending to finish this himself. When he raised his great-axe to the sky, bellowing the order, lightning struck from out of the clear blue sky. The bolt blinding, the crack deafening, all paused and watched. With renewed strength and magical energy coursing through his veins and the axe, he leaped into the fray, a storm of fire, ice, and lightning. Giants fell beneath one mighty blow from him, and he was untouchable as he carved a path to the king. </p>
        <p>Thulkaum’s honor guard fled or fell before his wrath, and he faced down the king. They fought, and when Arkazar’s axe met Thulkaum’s greatsword, it sliced it in two, and he spun, throwing the axe into the fire giant’s chest. Then he leaped, summoning the axe to his hand, the force pulling Thulkaum to his knees, and Arkazar split his head down the middle. Landing, he swiftly sliced off the head.</p>
        <p>Leaderless, the giants failed to rally behind a single ruler and either retreated or were killed.</p>
        <p>Upon the rock outcropping, Arkazar slew his foe he built his home. House Waterstriker still stands to this day. Swifthallow became a home to a united dragonborn people, and the city center became a monument to those who fought and died for their land. Their main export became blood iron, waiting long enough for the mineral to form. The mine is the deepest on Sapiria.</p>
        
        <p>10 years after the founding of Swifthallow, Arkazar journeyed east across the ocean to establish trade routes. He ended up in Waterdeep, where he met with the Open Lord, Laeral Silverhand, and was invited to the tenth Terra Day celebration in Trollskull Alley. While setting up, the players were attacked by a Death Knight of the ancient lich Abraxa. Arkazar, who had met with them early and knew the situation, volunteered to help free Phandelin when they had news of tons of undead attacking during the celebration.</p>
        <p>Arkazar made a deal with Jeff, allowing him access to airships in exchange for Sapirian goods, including blood iron. This led to Swifthallow being one of the largest hubs for airships, which grew after the invention of skydock spires.</p>
        <p>Sierra Morningstar went with Arkazar to Sapiria, and they eventually fell in love and got married. When he eventually died, Arkazar gave his axe to his eldest son to be passed down the line. However, the axe’s magical abilities will not be wielded by anyone it deems unworthy and by someone outside of the Waterstriker family. There have been no “worthy” members in the family until Severin. The axe was given the name Arkazar after its legendary owner.</p>
