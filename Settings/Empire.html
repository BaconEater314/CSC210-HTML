        <p>This page is dedicated to the Rise of an Empire Campaign and the events that proceed it.</p>

        <h2>The Next Chapter of Sapirian</h2>
        <p>Welcome back to Sapiria, a different place from when you left. With Moonstone defeated, your characters were hailed as legendary heroes. But their time has passed, and it is now time for new heroes to rise from the ashes, coming from the most unlikely places, each with their opportunity to make their mark on this world or become a footnote in the history books, long forgotten and ignored. Who will they be? Who will they become? What deeds will they be remembered by?</p>
        <p>5 years after the defeat of Davolm Moonstone, Kanari was on the brink of civil war. The citizens of the east claimed independence, led by their elected leader, King Severin Waterstriker. Though it was not what he wanted, he led for the good of the people. This is when a new player came in. When the stars aligned and the borders between the worlds were thin, people came across. Their intentions were unknown at first, but soon it was evident: They were here to conquer.</p>
        <p>An army, no, a country had traversed the world and landed in a place somewhat familiar to them: The Dead City. For it was their architectural style, though ancient compared to this group. At their head, a general named Elaythis, a ruthless dictator, a fearless warrior.</p>
        <p>Elaythis founded New Mazteca and claimed that all peoples of the continent were beneath his rule. You can imagine how that went with Kanari, Duraria, and the newly founded Draconia. For 4 long years, war has raged, resulting in a bloody stalemate. Fewer and fewer battles are fought on the fields, and attempts at diplomacy have been met with violence from Elaythis.</p>
        <p>Elaythis's armies consist mostly of Tabaxi warriors. His tactics and the skill of his troops greatly outmatched anything the Sapirian generals could throw at him. He quickly gained ground, but was stopped by the sheer masses that could be thrown at him. Though his troops are limited, it seems he is here to stay, as any direct assault on Xelora, his capital, or any of his cities could cost countless lives.</p>
        
        <h2>And this is where you come in...</h2>
        <p>Call it fate or just plain old bad luck, you all have been captured by the New Maztecan army, your equipment confiscated, your pride perhaps damaged, but nonetheless alive. You may have your chance to escape if you make some friends or temporary allies and work together to survive the Pit, where you're the main entertainment event for the Maztecan masses.</p>
