        <h1>The Upside</h1>
        <h2>MAJOR SPOILERS FOR THE RISE OF AN EMPIRE CAMPAIGN</h2>
        <p>This page is dedicated to the The Upside Campaign Setting and the events that proceed it.</p>

        <h2>The Fall of New Mazteca</h2>
        <p>At the end of the war with New Maztica in the year 1710 DR, Emperor Elaythis was defeated at the hands of a Special Operations unit during the Siege of Xelora. After his death, Xelora fell to Draconian forces, and King Severin Waterstriker brought the city into his empire. With the New Maztican Empire defeated, peace could finally settle in the land of Sapiria. Or so they thought.</p>
        <p>Rebel cells of New Maztica still roamed the countryside and jungles, and King Severin spent many a resource to try to thin them out, his neighboring country, Kanari, refusing to help since Draconia seceded before the war. Rebel cells still exist to this day, though they have little chance of bringing back their old empire and have settled for retaining their old ways, to some extent. Xelora has since been demilitarized and set up with its own local government which it retains to this day.</p>
        <p>The ways to travel the worlds have opened up a new opportunity to trade with the true Maztican, indifferent and apologetic for what they had done, and Ardonia. Ardonia was ecstatic to learn of the discovery of the 5th Song of War, and were eager to trade, though were soon consumed with their own issues with the return of the Voltaris and the threat of necromancers.</p>
        <p>The rest, is history. Now in the year 1910, 200 years after the fall of Elaythis, with technological advances, society is much different from the old days of the empire.</p>

        <br>

        <h2>The Rise of Industrialism</h2>
        <p>A lot has changed over 200 years. With the invention of the Steam Engine in 1786, industrial manufacturing operations began to expand exponentially in size. Then when the Electromagnetic Generator was invented in 1831, electricity was harnessed for the first time in a truly controlled manner. Expensive, dangerous and inefficient lightning harvesting airships were replaced with cheap, easy to control and highly efficient steam dynamos. What began from these two inventions, almost 50 years apart, was an industrial revolution. Trade goods became mass produced, which made cart travel inefficient, so the Automobile was invented to carry heavy loads over long distances faster and more safely than ever. The increase of trade necessitated quicker communications amongst trade partners, so the telegraph was invented, but even the telegraph was impractical for everyday business, so the telephone was invented. </p>
        <p>Then, they discovered petroleum in Zakhara.</p>
        <p>Drilling operations became lucrative, enriching the Caliphs and those that ventured to cut deals with them.  Petroleum refining was invented shortly after, which allowed the creation of plastics, asphalt, and most importantly, fuel oil. Fuel oil was cleaner burning and longer burning than the coal used to fuel steam engines. Energy production became more efficient. The abundance of electricity made the cost of automobiles plummet, making cars more than a luxury for the rich or a tool for businesses. Travel became cheaper than ever, short distances by car, and long distances by airship. Immigration across the globe spread the industrial revolution from Faerun to the rest of the world in just 60 years from the invention of the steam engine. Today, the Sword Coast has become a melting pot of culture and the epicenter of global finance.</p>

        <h2>An Era Without Much Magic</h2>
        <p>Magic at this age has fallen out of style. People have less and less time and money to dedicate themselves to Wizardry, except for the richer upper class. Nature is less and less prevalent, especially in the urban environment, leaving Druids to abandon cities and towns and stay in seclusion. Warlock Pacts are often discouraged, and with the printing press, the dangers of such a pact are widely known and avoided.</p>
        <p>The most common spellcasters of this age are Clerics and Sorcerers, though the former are more technologically based than divine magic-based. Religions and gods still exist, though few these days are willing to dedicate themselves fully to gain little power. While divine power is more reputable than Warlock Pacts, both have tenets and rules that must be followed, and the common folk are not willing to do it for what it's worth.</p>
        <p>Sorcerers, on the other hand, are people born with magic. Those who don’t have to learn and are simply lucky enough to be born with power, though it can still run rich in upper-class lineages. The most common are those born with the unpredictable Wild Magic, followed by those who draw on the powers of electricity common in this day and age (Storm Sorcery). The others, the more reclusive bunch, draw on the moons and the shadows during the night.</p>
        <p>Paladins are still fueled by their oaths, though more devoted to causes and people these days over entities, deities, and nature.</p>
        <p>Ranger magic is more based on their natural and trained intuition to spot the unnatural, track creatures, and discover the unknown.</p>
        <p>Bards, though less common than Clerics and Sorcerers, still exist. In fact, odds are that a man on stage performing can perform a little bit of music magic.</p>
        <p>Artificers, like always, are still technologically based. Infusions are simply upgrades invented by them, and they don’t necessarily create magic items; they create tech equivalents.</p>

        <h2>The Five Families</h2>
        <p>The Five Families are the five most powerful criminal syndicates in the city. Comprised of the <b>Five Dragons Triad, Yaguára Cartel, Cappodocian Family, Sakazuki-Gumi, and The Northside Mob.</b> The families bicker and feud with each other often and alliances are tenuous. Each family is primarily involved in a major crime; The Five Dragons deal in Human Trafficking, The Yaguára Cartel are the premier manufacturer of narcotics, the Cappadocians control gambling operations, the Sakazuki-Gumi are extortionists and loan sharks, and the Northside Mob controls Bootlegging operations.</p>

        <h3>The Five Dragons Triad</h3>
        <p>The Five Dragons Triad are said to have descended from members of a long-defeated Dragon Cult from two hundred years ago. They operate a huge human trafficking ring, smuggling people in and out of the city; Many are never seen again. Some say that those trafficked are being sacrificed to an ancient dragon god. Members are primarily human, though take Draconic names.</p>

        <h3>Yaguára Cartel</h3>
        <p>Founded by remnants of the Interdimensional invasion of the Maztican army who refused to assimilate, they operate with militaristic efficiency, ruling over the city’s drug game. They are one of the smaller families, as they mostly consist of the original Maztican races: Orcs, Half-Orcs, Ardoni, and Tabaxi, and are particular about who they let into their family, but are highly efficient with their work.</p>

        <p><b>Enemies:</b> Cappadocian Family, Sakazuki-Gumi</p>

        <h3>Cappodocian Family</h3>
        <p>The oldest of the Five Families, The Cappadocian Family was founded in 1630 DR by Giovanni Cappadocian. The Cappadocian operate a byzantine operation with fingers in every pie at the governmental level, granting them near immunity for their operations. They control a city-wide ring of casinos, horse betting, and underground fight clubs, where they sucker the desperate out of their money with fixed games. Under the boss and his Consigliere are 16 Caporegimes who each operate a team of 12-16 made men, as well as hundreds of associates affiliated with the family despite not being made men.</p>

        <h3>Sakazuki-Gumi</h3>
        <p>Founded by immigrants from Wa and Kozakura, Members of the Sakazuki-Gumi ink themselves with elaborate tattoos on their backs to identify their membership. Members follow a strict honor code, and those who shame the family are punished by having fingers cut off, while those accused of more serious offenses will commit ritual suicide. They offer high interest loans to those who can't get one from the banks, with brutal consequences for those who fail to pay on time.</p>

        <h3>The Northside Mob</h3>
        <p>The largest of the Five Families, The Northside Mob is a loose coalition of various local operations, from family bootlegging businesses to small-medium sized gangs of their own, though they are all unified under the Northside Banner by threat of retaliation by Paddy O'Neil; Some merely pay lip service, while others are fiercely loyal. They are hard to pin down and reproduce like a hydra. Every operation destroyed spawns two more. Most operations run just outside city limits, brewing and smuggling bootleg alcohol into the city.</p>

        <h2>The Corporations</h2>
        <p>Globe-spanning titans of industry, to most, the corporations represent the same things the Five Families do, criminality and greed, only with the exception that they are legally allowed to operate. The CEOs, often called <b>The Robber Barons</b> by the people, are some of the most powerful people on the planet, more powerful than even the governments of some nations.</p>
        
        <h3>Deeprock Corporation</h3>
        <p>What was once a small time Dwarven Mining operation has ballooned into a titan of the mining industry. They are the textbook example of “horizontal integration,” controlling all of the mining operations of the Sapirian continent, and are voyaging eastward to the Sword Coast to expand their influence. They also have been getting involved in glyphid hunting as of more recently. They are the only company to have a strong labor union, and as a result of such, are constantly embroiled in negligence and workman’s compensation lawsuits.</p>
        <p><b>CEO:</b> Kivish Bronzehatchet</p>
        <p><b>Headquarters:</b> Duria, Duraria, Sapiria</p>

        <h3>Standard Electric</h3>
        <p>Standard Electric has sunk their teeth deep into the city’s power grid. Their lobbying of the government has made electricity totally privatized. With total control of the power grid, they have been able to hike the price of electricity, leaving thousands in the dark. The CEO is also suspected of being a vampire.</p>
        <p><b>CEO:</b> Alaric Voss</p>
        <p><b>Headquarters:</b> Swifthallow, Draconia, Sapiria</p>

        <h3>Sword Coast Trader’s Bank</h3>
        <p>One of the largest and oldest of the corporations, Sword Coast Trader’s Bank had a rocky start back in the 1480s. Initially, their service was straightforward, one could deposit their hard earned coin, and withdraw it later at one of their branches in Baldur’s Gate or Waterdeep, or at the central location in Daggerford. It was their Lending division that caused trouble, though, as the people of Daggerford were skeptical of the company, preferring to work with their local acquaintances, but they decided to take a gamble and expand their lending to their branches. Their gamble paid off, and Sword Coast Trader’s Bank has ballooned into a massive operation that's just too big to fail.</p>
        <p><b>CEO:</b> Lord Dulbravvan Anteos V</p>
        <p><b>Headquarters:</b> Daggerford, Delimbiyr Vale, Sword Coast, Faerûn</p>

        <h3>Asahara Holdings, Inc.</h3>
        <p>What started in 1650 as a young man traveling door to door selling linens after being inspired by a story about a beggar who became a millionaire by trading a piece of straw has exploded into a global finance titan. Asahara is a completely different beast compared to Faerûnian corporations, the Zaibatsu model. Zaibatsu corporations like Asahara hold significant influence over the Waan economy, though Asahara is as of yet the only one of these industrial titans to breach the international market.. Its nickname in its home country is the “Yamata-no-Orochi,” or “The 8 Headed Serpent,” a title it picked up from its 8 divisions which almost act as companies of their own; Foods, Textiles, Machinery, Metals & Minerals, Energy & Chemicals, Communications, Realty, and “The 8th Company” which mediates the frequent internal disputes between the 8 divisions. </p>
        <p><b>CEO:</b> Masayoshi Asahara</p>
        <p><b>Headquarters:</b> Uwaji, Tsukishima, Wa, Kara-Tur</p>

        <h3>Vargr</h3>
        <p>A “security” company only in the loosest sense, Vargr is an Icewind Dale based company that works in the business of soldiers of fortune. Hired by governments and corporations alike, Vargr forces are known to be some of the best of the best. Founded by the son of the Jarl of Caer-Konig, Vargr has deep ties to the Zhentarim, and is suspected of having involvement in rebellions, revolutions, and civil wars across Faerûn and Zakhara, as well as busting Deeprock Miner’s Union strikes.</p>
        <p><b>CEO:</b> Johan Gustávsonn</p>
        <p><b>Headquarters:</b> Caer-Konig, Icewind Dale, Faerûn</p>

        <h3>Winston Arms</h3>
        <p>The newest and smallest of the companies, Winston Arms is a growing weapons manufacturer, what they lack in hard corporate power, they more than make up for with their lucrative arms deals, allowing Winston Arms to secure contracts with much bigger fish than themselves.</p>
        <p><b>CEO:</b> Winston White</p>
        <p><b>Headquarters:</b> Duria, Duraria, Sapiria</p>

        <br>

        <h2>Glyphids</h2>
        <p>Deep below the surface, ancient Duergar caverns sprawl for miles, teeming with subterranean life, precious minerals and providing access to the Underdark. Construction and excavation on the surface in the last 40 years has disturbed the caverns beneath, which has driven some of the wildlife upwards, though none have been more affected than the <b>Glyphids</b>. Giant armored arachnids, Glyphids are predatory, eusocial, and highly territorial. Nymphal glyphids, colloquially referred to as <b>swarmers</b> have become somewhat common pests in basements and sewers, though mature glyphids are thankfully rare to find outside of their endemic caverns.</p>
        <p>Glyphids are prized for their thick chitin, which can be worked into sturdy plates that are as hard as softer metals like bronze, without being conductive. Worker glyphids, or <b>Grunts</b>, are generally safe enough to farm, though domesticated glyphids are still rather feisty. The larger and more dangerous of the glyphid castes have to be hunted. The <b>Deeprock Corporation</b> employs crews to hunt and recover some of the most dangerous types.</p>
