        <h2>Patrick “Paddy” O’Neil</h2>
        <p>Paddy isn't the Leader of the Northside Mob, per se, but he controls the most powerful operation in the region, and extorts protection fees from the other, smaller ones. Paddy is somewhat of a loose cannon, and has a habit of making examples out of those who cross him, especially to operations that refuse to pay tribute to him and his family.</p>
