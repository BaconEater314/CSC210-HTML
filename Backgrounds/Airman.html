        <h1><b>Airman</b></h1>
        <p><i>The sailor of the skies, you spent many a days up in the air, flying around the world and catching lightning to sell. </i></p>
        <p><b>This background is designed for the Sapirian settings.</b></p>

        <div>
            <p><b>Weapons:</b> Lightning Firearms</p>
            <p><b>Tools:</b> Navigator's tools, vehicles (air)</p>
            <p><b>Equipment:</b> A lightning railgun, 10 tiny lightning cartridges, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 20 gp.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Airship Role</h3>
        <div>
            <p><b>Captain:</b> As the captain of a vessel you steered, made deals, and commanded your crew. You have a commanding voice that carries. You gain proficiency with Persuasion and Perception. You also gain a set of navigator’s tools.</p>
            <p><b>Crewmate:</b> As a crewman, you worked hard to make the ship fly smoothly, from dealing with the riggings to fighting off pirates and cleaning out latrines. You gain proficiency with Athletics and Acrobatics. You also gain proficiency in two martial weapons of your choice or one set of tools.</p>
            <p><b></b> Lightning Catchers work in storms to catch and store lightning to sell, or use in lightning railguns. It’s a hard profession but can be rewarding for those who brave the fiercest storms and bring home the most powerful bolts. You gain proficiency in Sleight of Hand and Survival. You also gain proficiency with lightning-catching equipment and start with 5 small lightning cartridges.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ships Passage</h2>
        <p>You are well adjusted to the high altitudes and cold temperatures from your year(s) of flying up high. High altitudes have no effect on you and you survive at slightly lower temperatures than the average person. You are also (most likely) not afraid of heights.</p>

        <h2>Ships Passage</h2>
        <p>When you need to, you can secure free passage on an airship for yourself and your adventuring companions. You might sail on the ship you served on, or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps one captained by a former crewmate). Because you're calling in a favor, you can't be certain of a schedule or route that will meet your every need. Your DM will determine how long it takes to get where you need to go. In return for your free passage, you and your companions are expected to assist the crew during the voyage.</p>
