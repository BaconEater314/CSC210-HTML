        <h1><b>Voidbringer Crewmate</b></h1>
        <p><i>You died once, at the hands of Arella Ostanos and her crew of undead warriors. You were resurrected to serve her, to fight alongside her on her conquest of the skies. When she retired, her powers purified or not, she was able to fully revive them all, allowing them to return to their lives. Your link to her still has not left, strangely, and neither have the skills you gained during your time with her.</i></p>
        <p><b>This background is designed for the Rise of an Empire and Grimm Campaign settings.</b></p>

        <div>
            <p><b>Skills:</b> Intimidation, Perception</p>
            <p><b>Tools:</b> Vehicles (Air)</p>
            <p><b>Weapons:</b> Scimitar, Longsword</p>
            <p><b>Languages:</b> Celestial.</p>
            <p><b>Equipment:</b> A rusty scimitar you used to wield a zombie, a piece of wood or metal that was stuck in your undead corpse, a set of dark common clothes, and a pouch contianing 20 GP.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Undead Link</h2>
        <p>Your link with Arella has strangely not abated. You know her approximate location and have learned how to use it to navigate across Sapiria as a reference anchor. You may still be compelled to take orders from her, should she speak to you, but she is not impossible to resist. She gave you free will after all.</p>
