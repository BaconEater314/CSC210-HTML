        <h1><b>Dragon Cultist</b></h1>
        <p><i>Prerequisite: Race native to Sapiria during the time of the Dragon Cult</i></p>
        <p><i>The Dragon Cultist is a background that any race that has scales, fur, a shell, feathers, or is made of mushroom cannot take.</i></p>
        <p><i>You have dragon blood tattoos grafted into your arms, chest, or head in any pattern. They are irremovable short of a Wish spell.</i></p>
        <p><i>Following the fall of the Dragon Blood Cult at the hands of heroes (marked by the death of Alabastros), the very few cultists who survived attempted to return to normal life. Your power has diminished since then, but you still retain some benefits. However, they are forever marked and typically shunned by society as a whole. If you have this modifier, think about what caused you to join the cult and what role you played.</i></p>

        <p><b>This background is designed for the Rise of an Empire and Grimm Campaign setting.</b></p>

        <div>
            <p><b>Skills:</b> Religion</p>
            <p><b>Tools:</b> Tool proficiencies.</p>
            <p><b>Languages:</b> Languages.</p>
            <p><b>Equipment:</b> A set of common clothes that covers your tattoos (including a hood), an pouch containing an old memento, a set of rusty dragon blood grafting tools, and a pouch containing 25 GP.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p><b>Blood Blessing:</b> You have undergone the vile ritual of grafting dragon blood onto your skin, forever marking you as a cultist. You pick a tattoo color and gain resistance to the related damage type: Red (fire), White (cold), Green (poison), Black (acid), or Blue (lightning). You can speak, read, and write Draconic and choose one of the following blood features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b></b> You were part of the forward attack troops, making up the bulk of the cultists. You gain proficiency in Intimidation. Additionally, when you hit an enemy with a melee attack, you deal additional damage based on your resistance equal to your proficiency bonus.</li>
                <li>
                    <b></b> You were part of the recruiting section of cultists, bringing in new members and grafting blood tattoos on them. Your tattoos cover your head and face. You gain proficiency in Persuasion and Sculptor’s Tools. Additionally, you gain a cantrip based on your color, with Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as your spellcasting ability for that cantrip (choose when you select this background):
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Black:</b> Acid Splash</li>
                        <li><b>Blue:</b> Shocking Grasp</li>
                        <li><b>Green:</b> Poison Spray</li>
                        <li><b>Red:</b> Firebolt</li>
                        <li><b>White:</b> Ray of Frost</li>
                    </ul>
                    You also may breathe draconic energy. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in a 15-foot cone (fire, cold, poison) or a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide (lightning, acid). Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity (Fire, Lightning, Acid) or Constitution (Poison, Cold) saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes 2d6 damage of the type associated with your resistance. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (3d6), 11th level (4d6), and 17th level (5d6). You can use your Breath Weapon once per short or long rest.
                </li>
                <li><b>Bloodchest:</b> You were part of the rear troops, typically dealing with enemies at range, though not afraid to get your hands dirty. Your tattoos cover your torso. You gain proficiency in Intimidation. Additionally, as a bonus action on your turn, you gain spectral wings the color of your tattoos for one minute, giving a fly speed equal to your walking speed. You can do this once per short rest.</li>
                <li><b>Bloodfoot:</b> You were part of the scout troops, a rare blessing that appeared toward the end of Alabastros’s reign. Your tattoos cover your legs and feet. You gain proficiency with Acrobatics. Additionally, you gain a +5 to your move speed and can use your bonus action to give enemies disadvantage on opportunity attacks made against you until the start of your next turn. At 5th level, you can cast Ashardalon’s Stride once per long rest and with any spell slots you have.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Shunned by Society</h2>
        <p>As an ex-cultist, you are shunned by society as a whole if they know you have tattoos, so it is typically best to keep them hidden. You will typically be refused service or help if it is known. Additionally, your alignment cannot be Lawful Good because of your previous choices and the soft, hidden voice of Alabastros in the back of your mind whispering evil thoughts. His blood mixed with the chromatic blood has kept you sane, but still affects your mind.</p>
        
        <h3>Character Concepts with this Background:</h3>
        <ul>

            <li>You became a Paladin to redeem yourself and have sworn to wipe out any remaining cultists and their evil. (works well with Oath of Redemption/Vengeance)</li>
            <li>The voice of Alabastros can drive you into a frenzied rage</li>
            <li>Tinkering/Studying helps you ignore the voice in the back of your head.</li>
            <li>You sought monkhood to find inner peace from Alabastros’s voice.</li>
        </ul>
