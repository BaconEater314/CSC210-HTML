        <h2>Bootleg Connections</h2>
        <p>Running a Juice Joint isn't easy. Crackdowns on alcohol mean you need inroads with some less-than-reputable characters to supply your patrons with the real McCoy.</p>
        <p>You have connections to bootlegging operations who are willing to provide you with some basic services, including chauffeuring, couriering, and can offer a single safehouse on the outskirts of the city which allows up to 6 people to live a Poor lifestyle away from the prying eyes of the law. Bootleggers use the commoner statblock, wear padded armor, and carry Lightning Pistols to defend themselves, but will not fight for you.</p>
