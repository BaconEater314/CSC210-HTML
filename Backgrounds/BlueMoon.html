        <p><i>Prerequisite: Goblin</i></p>
        <p><i>Warriors of the Blue Moon are a group of Goblin Warriors that defended the Blue Moon Orchard and Vineyard. They were instrumental during the Battle of Rivermere, coming to the defense of the town and fighting off the Mazetecan armies, allowing the people to escape. Though mostly destroyed and disbanded after the Battle, few warriors still exist and are known for their valor and skill in battle.</i></p>
